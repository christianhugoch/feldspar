# Saltcorn v2 — Concurrent code bodies: many runs per isolate

Ordered, checkable task list for the twelfth milestone after the MVP. Earlier lists are
archived in [docs/TODO-mvp.md](./TODO-mvp.md) (the MVP),
[docs/TODO-post-mvp-1.md](./TODO-post-mvp-1.md) (file stores + the React framework),

rich types and File fields), [docs/TODO-post-mvp-3.md](./TODO-post-mvp-3.md) (ownership
formulae, calculated fields and row-level security),
[docs/TODO-post-mvp-4.md](./TODO-post-mvp-4.md) (actions and triggers),
[docs/TODO-post-mvp-5.md](./TODO-post-mvp-5.md) (the file-store IDE),

generated client), [docs/TODO-post-mvp-9.md](./TODO-post-mvp-9.md) (table constraints
and indexes), [docs/TODO-post-mvp-10.md](./TODO-post-mvp-10.md) (email) and
[docs/TODO-post-mvp-11.md](./TODO-post-mvp-11.md) (tables in code). Scope and rationale
remain in [docs/GOALS.md](./GOALS.md) and
[docs/TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md](./TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md).

The previous milestone gave `run_js_code` tables. It gave them **synchronously**, and that
decision — right for getting the seam built, and honestly documented as a decision — bought
correctness with the one currency the server cannot spend: concurrency. A host call blocks its
isolate thread (`crates/sc-expr/src/code.rs`, `host_call`'s `handle.block_on`) for the whole
round trip to the database, and a worker checks out one job at a time. So the number of
`run_js_code` requests this server can serve **at once** is `DEFAULT_CODE_WORKERS`. Two.

Everything else about the design is already asynchronous and already scales: the query itself is
awaited on the caller's runtime, the row layer is async throughout, the connection pool bounds
itself. The blocking is *only* in the guest seam, and it costs a thread per concurrent run —
which is exactly the thing a server must not spend per request.

Nor is it only a throughput ceiling. A code body's write raises table events, so a body whose
`.insert()` fires a second `run_js_code` trigger needs a *second* worker while still holding its
own. With two workers, two such requests hold both, the nested runs never get one, and all four
fail at the wall clock. The pool size is not a tuning knob there; it is `1 + max nesting depth ×
concurrency`, which is not a number anyone can pick.

This milestone makes `db` **awaitable**, so that a run costs a pending promise rather than a
thread, and one isolate serves hundreds of runs at once.

**Milestone definition of done:** with the default two isolates, 500 concurrent requests each
firing a `run_js_code` trigger that reads and writes are served concurrently — the fake-host
integration test observes hundreds of host calls in flight at once, and the wall clock is the
database's, not the pool's. A trigger whose write fires a second `run_js_code` trigger completes
on a **one-worker** pool. A body that loops without yielding still fails, alone where that can be
told, and says which trigger did it. And the body reads the way its author expects:

```js
const overdue = await db.invoices
  .where({ paid: false, due: { lt: payload.today } })
  .orderBy("due")
  .limit(50)
  .rows();

for await (const inv of db.customers.where({ active: true }).iter()) { … }

const [chased, owed] = await Promise.all([
  db.reminders.insert(overdue.map((i) => ({ invoice: i.id }))),
  db.invoices.where({ paid: false }).sum("amount"),
]);
```

Legend: `[ ]` todo · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` done.

## The specification

### 1. The guest API becomes asynchronous

Every terminal returns a Promise: `.rows()`, `.row()`, the scalars, `.insert()`, `.update()`,
`.delete()`, `.sql()`. `.iter()` becomes an **async generator**, walked with `for await`. The
body itself is wrapped in an `async function`, so `await` at its top level is legal, and
`__scRun`'s current refusal of a returned Promise inverts: a returned Promise is what a body now
answers with, and it is awaited.

The chain stays pure and synchronous — `db.invoices.where(…).orderBy(…)` builds a plan and
touches nothing — so only the terminals change. That is what keeps the diff to the prelude small
and the surface recognisable.

### 2. A forgotten `await` must not be silent

This is the tax the change levies, and it is paid here rather than by every trigger author.
`JSON.stringify(promise)` is `{}`, `if (promise)` is true, and `for (const r of promise)` is a
bare `TypeError` — three ways for a missing `await` to look like a wrong answer instead of a
mistake. So a terminal answers a `DbPromise` (a `Promise` subclass) whose `toJSON`,
`Symbol.toPrimitive` and `Symbol.iterator` all throw one named error: *this database call was
not awaited — write `await db.invoices.rows()`*. It costs nothing when the body is right.

### 3. Many runs on one isolate

A run stops being "what the isolate is doing" and becomes an **entry in a table**, keyed by a
token minted per run:

- `RunState` moves from a single `OpState` slot to a `HashMap<RunToken, RunState>`. The host,
  the deadline, the call budget and the bindings are per entry, exactly as they are per run now;
  what goes away is `handle`, because nothing blocks any more.
- The token is a random 128 bits, bound as a `const` in the run's own function scope. Not an
  index: two runs on one isolate may carry different authority (`db.asUser()` delegates to *this*
  event's caller), and a body must not be able to reach another's host by writing `1`.
- The op no longer blocks. `op_sc_db` becomes an ordinary `async` op that awaits
  `BridgeHost::call` — which already only sends on a channel and awaits a oneshot, so its future
  needs no reactor of its own and is driven by the isolate's own event loop.
- A run's result is delivered by a **completion op** (`__scDone` / `__scFail`) rather than by
  `execute_script`'s return value, because with runs resident that return value is a pending
  promise and the event loop, not the call, is what finishes a run. A syntax error still surfaces
  synchronously from the call, and still should.
- The worker thread becomes a current-thread tokio runtime driving `run_event_loop`, accepting
  new jobs while the resident ones are in flight.

### 4. The two clocks

Today one watchdog enforces one run's JS time by terminating the isolate. With runs multiplexed
that instrument is too blunt to keep pointed the same way: terminating the isolate stops
everyone. So the two things it currently does are separated.

- **The wall clock** (`timeout_ms`, per run) needs no termination at all. A run past its deadline
  is refused its next host call, and the caller stops waiting `CALLER_GRACE` later — both already
  written, both already correct, and between them they cover every run that is *waiting* rather
  than *running*. Which, for an I/O-bound body, is all of them.
- **The JS slice** is new and is what the watchdog now enforces: how long a body may run
  **without yielding**. Small (default 1 s, never more than the run's remaining wall clock),
  because a body that computes for a second between two queries is already pathological. A
  `while (true) {}` is caught in a second rather than in five.

Attribution: the isolate records the running run as each one starts and as each resumes (a cheap
sync mark from the guest at the point a host call returns), so a slice overrun blames the body
that actually overran it and names its trigger.

The co-residents are the honest part. Termination takes them with it, and they must **not** be
silently re-run: a body that has already inserted rows is not idempotent, and re-executing it is
a worse failure than the one being handled. So a run that has made **zero** host calls is
re-queued (provably no side effects yet); every other resident fails with its own named error
saying another body on the same isolate did not yield. Rare, loud, and never a duplicated write.

### 5. Admission, and what the ceiling becomes afterwards

Concurrency is no longer free-of-threads-but-free-of-everything: each resident run holds its
scope, its bindings and up to a 1000-row read in the V8 heap. So a worker admits at most
`max_inflight` runs (default 256; two workers → 512) and the rest queue exactly as they do now,
with queue time still inside the deadline. The isolate gets a heap limit and a near-heap-limit
callback, so pressure refuses new admissions instead of aborting the process.

Past that the ceiling is the **database connection pool**, which is the right place for it and
already bounds itself — a fact worth stating in §10.1, because it is the answer to "how many
`run_js_code` requests can this server serve" once this milestone lands.

---

## Decisions taken up front

1. **Async, not a source transform.** Rewriting the body with swc to insert `await` at every
   terminal was considered and rejected: aliasing (`const f = db.books.rows; f()`) makes it
   unsound, and a surface that is *sometimes* magic is worse than one that is honestly async.
2. **The pool stays small.** More isolates buy CPU parallelism, which is not what is short; this
   milestone buys concurrency. `DEFAULT_CODE_WORKERS` stays 2.
3. **The seam does not change.** `CodeHost` still takes one JSON plan and answers one JSON value.
   Nothing in `sc-api`'s host, the plan language, authority, the row cap or the cascade guard is
   touched by this milestone — §15's other guest languages inherit the same plans.
4. **No backwards compatibility for the synchronous spelling.** Prototype status: existing bodies,
   tests, docs and the editor's `.d.ts` are updated to `await`, and the sync form is gone rather
   than deprecated.
5. ~~**`fetch` and timers stay out.**~~ **Superseded for `fetch`** (see the addendum below).
   This milestone built the plumbing that made it possible and did not use it; `fetch` was then
   asked for and added on top, on the same seam. Timers stay out.

---

## Phase 1 — The awaitable guest API (`sc-expr`)

- [x] `op_sc_db` becomes an `async` op awaiting the host directly; `host_call`'s
      `handle.block_on` and `RunState::handle` go away. Still one run per isolate at this phase,
      so the change is the API shape and nothing else — and is reviewable on its own.
- [x] `DB_PRELUDE`: `__scDbCall` returns a Promise; every terminal awaits it; `iterate` becomes
      `async function*`. The chain builders stay synchronous and untouched.
- [x] `build_code_script` wraps the body in an `async function`; `__scRun` awaits the result
      instead of refusing a Promise (`code.rs`'s current refusal inverts).
- [x] `DbPromise` with throwing `toJSON` / `Symbol.toPrimitive` / `Symbol.iterator`, so a
      forgotten `await` is one named error rather than `{}`, `true`, or a bare `TypeError`.
- [x] The worker drives `run_event_loop` after `execute_script` so a single run's promises
      actually settle; the watchdog is paused across the whole event-loop wait as it is across a
      host call today. **Deviation:** the watchdog is left *armed* across the event-loop wait
      and paused only by the op, exactly as it is today — pausing it wholesale would leave a
      `while (true)` after an `await` unbounded, losing the worker rather than the run. The
      run's wall clock now bounds the whole event-loop wait instead, which covers the case that
      motivated the bullet (a body suspended on a promise that never settles).
- [x] Update every existing code test in `sc-expr` and `sc-api` to `await`, which is also the
      check that the surface reads the way §1 claims.

## Phase 2 — Many runs per isolate

- [x] `RunState` becomes a table keyed by a 128-bit random `RunToken`, bound as a `const` in the
      run's scope; `op_sc_db` takes the token and looks the run up. An unknown token is a named
      error, not a panic.
- [x] Completion ops `__scDone` / `__scFail`, and the run's oneshot moves into the table entry:
      `execute_script` starts a run, the event loop finishes it. Errors carry `e.stack` so the
      message an admin sees is no worse than today's.
- [x] The worker becomes `Builder::new_current_thread()` + `block_on`: a loop that admits jobs
      while pumping the event loop, and that parks on the job channel when nothing is resident
      (never a busy poll). It waits on a **third** thing as well: a timer at the next deadline,
      because a resident run's wall clock has to be enforceable while nothing at all is executing.
      That replaces phase 1's `unwind_expired`, which the token makes moot.
- [x] Per-worker job channels with a least-inflight dispatcher (an `AtomicUsize` per worker)
      replacing the shared `Mutex<Receiver>`, so admission is load-aware and needs no MPMC
      dependency.
- [x] `max_inflight` per worker (default 256), with the overflow queued exactly as now
      (`CodeRuntime::with_workers_and_inflight`; the `DenoEvaluator` knob is phase 5's).
- [x] Caller side: `CodeRuntime::run`'s serving loop keeps in-flight host calls in a
      `FuturesUnordered` instead of awaiting each inline, so a body's `Promise.all([…])` issues
      its queries **in parallel**. Borrowed host, no spawn, no `'static` requirement.
- [x] Test: on a **one-worker** pool, 200 runs against a fake host that sleeps 50 ms each
      complete in ~one round trip's order of magnitude, and the host records ≥ 100 calls in
      flight at once.
- [x] Test: runs do not leak into each other — 50 concurrent runs with distinct bindings each
      assert their own values, and one run exhausting its call budget leaves the others' budgets
      untouched.
- [x] Test: a code body whose `.insert()` fires a second `run_js_code` trigger completes on a
      one-worker pool. This is the deadlock the milestone removes, and it deserves a test that
      would have failed before it.

*Deviation:* the watchdog is still one instrument per isolate, armed at the earliest JS deadline
any resident run has — a faithful generalisation of phase 1's single window, with the same
pause across each host call. So a run that does not yield still terminates its co-residents,
whether it spins (`while (true) {}`) or simply never reaches an `await`. Phase 3's slice is what
fixes that, because a slice is armed for the *currently running* token rather than for every
resident one; splitting the clocks, attributing the overrun and sparing the co-residents is
where the milestone already puts it. Multiplexing also needed one
thing phase 2's list does not mention: `deno_core` halts the event loop on an **unhandled promise
rejection**, which with runs resident is every body punished for one body's dropped `db` call, so
the isolate now installs a handler that says such a rejection is handled (a run's own failure never
arrives that way — `__scRun` attaches a rejection handler to the body's promise).

## Phase 3 — The two clocks and the runaway

- [x] Split the budgets: the per-run wall clock keeps its two existing enforcement points
      (deadline check in the op, `CALLER_GRACE` in `CodeRuntime::run`) and stops driving the
      watchdog; the watchdog enforces the **JS slice** (`DEFAULT_JS_SLICE`, 1 s, clamped to the
      run's remaining wall clock). The worker's reaper — phase 2's third enforcement point, for a
      run suspended past its deadline — stays, since it too costs the co-residents nothing.
- [x] Attribution: the isolate tracks the currently-running token — set when a run starts and by
      a cheap sync mark where a host call returns — so a slice overrun names the guilty body.
      *Deviation:* the mark is exact for a run that resumes alone in its turn of the event loop
      and best-effort when several resume together, because V8 runs every resumption handler of a
      turn before any of the bodies they wake, and no mark we can inject is deeper than the body's
      own continuation. Making it exact means releasing one host answer per turn — a serialisation
      of the hot path to improve a message. Documented at `op_sc_mark`. Two things the list did
      not mention proved necessary: the mark is **cleared when the event loop yields** (the one
      moment Rust can see JavaScript stop; clearing it later terminates an idle isolate under
      whoever runs next), and it is **left standing across `execute_script`** returning, which is
      what watches a body that yields only to the microtask queue (`for (;;) await null;`) — a
      shape that previously held its worker for ever.
- [x] On termination: `cancel_terminate_execution`, fail the guilty run with the slice error,
      re-queue only residents with **zero** host calls, fail the rest with their own named error.
      Drop the run table's entries either way, so nothing outlives the isolate that held it. A
      re-queued run carries the deadline it was first admitted with, so a retry cannot outlive the
      caller waiting on it.
- [x] V8 heap limit via `create_params` plus a near-heap-limit callback that stops admitting
      rather than aborting the process.
- [x] Tests: `while (true) {}` fails with the slice error and names the trigger; a co-resident
      that had made no host call still completes; one that had made a host call fails with the
      co-resident error rather than being re-run (asserted by counting the fake host's writes).

## Phase 4 — The hot path

- [x] Compile `DB_PRELUDE` **once per isolate** as a factory (`__scMakeDb(token)`) rather than
      splicing it into every run's script. The per-run `db` object is still fresh — decision 5 of
      the previous milestone (a body that assigns to `db` poisons nothing) is preserved by the
      factory, not by recompilation. *One consequence worth recording: the run token is now the
      factory's argument and lives in the handle's closure, so `__scTok` is gone from a body's
      scope — what a body holds is the handle.*
- [x] Cache the compiled body per isolate, keyed by a content hash the Rust side sends: a run is
      then `__scInvoke(token, key, bindings)`, with the source travelling only on a miss. A
      trigger firing 1000 times compiles once. The cache is bounded (`BODY_CACHE_CAPACITY`, 256)
      and evicts the least recently run body through `__scForget`; the definition is kept beside
      its key so a hash collision costs a recompile rather than running the wrong body.
- [x] Benchmark the three of them together (`cargo bench` or a timed test): runs/second on one
      isolate against a fake host, before and after, recorded in the CHANGELOG.
      *(`code::tests::throughput_of_one_isolate`: ~2,000 runs/second before, ~44,000 after.)*

## Phase 5 — Configuration, documentation and the definition of done

- [x] `DenoEvaluator::with_max_inflight` beside `with_code_workers`, and — the gap this milestone
      also closes — an actual config path: `sc-server` builds the evaluator with
      `DenoEvaluator::new()` and nothing reads either knob today. *(Both are now `ServerConfig`
      fields and `saltcorn serve` flags — `--code-workers`, `--code-max-inflight` — applied by
      `sc_server::js_evaluator`; flags rather than stored settings because a node's cores and
      memory are that node's, not the application's.)*
- [x] `docs/TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md` §10.1: "The API is **synchronous**" becomes its opposite, with
      the `for await` spelling, the two clocks, the admission bound, and the sentence naming the
      connection pool as the ceiling that remains. *(Done in phase 1: the synchronous claim, the
      `for await` spelling and every example. Done in phase 3: the two clocks, since leaving §10.1
      claiming three bounds once the slice existed would have been wrong rather than merely
      incomplete. Done here: "How many run at once" — the admission bound, the two flags that
      size it, and the connection pool as the ceiling that remains.)*
- [x] `ui/admin/src/codeTypes.ts`: terminals answer `Promise<…>`, `iter()` answers
      `AsyncIterableIterator<Row>`, and the doc comments lose "Synchronous — there are no promises
      in the sandbox". Monaco's own diagnostics then catch a forgotten `await` in the editor,
      which is where it is cheapest to catch.
- [x] `run_js_code`'s doc comment and `docs/tutorial-triggers.md`: every example gains its
      `await`, and the "the code is **synchronous**" bullet is replaced by what a body now has to
      know — await your queries, `Promise.all` is real parallelism, and a body that computes for a
      second without yielding is the one shape the runtime will refuse.
- [x] The end-to-end test the milestone is defined by: 500 concurrent trigger fires on the
      default pool, all served, none timing out.
      *(`sc-server/tests/concurrent_code_bodies.rs`.)*
- [x] CHANGELOG.

## Addendum — `fetch` in a code body

Added after the milestone was finished, at the user's request, and recorded here rather than
quietly: it reverses decision 5 for `fetch`, and the "explicitly out of scope" line below stood
until it did. What it does *not* reverse is the reason that line existed — the milestone itself
gained no capability, and this was built afterwards on the seam it left behind.

- [x] `FetchHost` in `sc-expr`: a second host trait of the same shape as `CodeHost` (one JSON
      request in, one JSON response out), a `fetch` field on `CodeCall`, and `op_sc_fetch` — an
      async op with a budget (`DEFAULT_MAX_FETCHES`, 50) and a clock of its own, clamped to what
      is left of the run less `FETCH_MARGIN` so a hung endpoint fails inside the body.
- [x] One bridge for both surfaces: `HostRequest` carries which one it is for, so a
      `Promise.all([fetch(…), db…])` is served in the one `FuturesUnordered` the caller already
      had, and no second channel or loop exists to keep in step.
- [x] `FETCH_PRELUDE`: `fetch`, `Headers` and `Response` — the web's shape, the web's rules (a
      non-2xx is an answer; a transport failure is a `TypeError`), and the four honest
      differences (no streaming, no `AbortSignal`, `timeout_ms`, an object body is JSON).
      Compiled once per isolate; `fetch` is minted per run by `__scMakeFetch(token)` and handed
      to the body as a parameter, exactly as `db` is.
- [x] `CodeFetchHost` in `sc-core-actions`, over the same `reqwest` client the `fetch` action
      uses and with the same rules (absolute `http`/`https` only), plus the response cap
      (`MAX_RESPONSE_BYTES`, 8 MB, refused rather than truncated and enforced chunk by chunk).
- [x] Tests: twelve in `sc-expr` against a fake network (the request a body builds, the response
      it reads, a 404 that does not throw, a `TypeError` it can catch, the budget, a forgotten
      `await`, two requests in flight at once, the clamp, bytes both ways, the refused options,
      read-once-and-clone) and five in `sc-core-actions` against a **real socket** (a GET and a
      POST as written, a body that writes what it fetched, a 503 it retries, a hung endpoint
      that fails inside the body's own limit, and `file://` refused).
- [x] `ui/admin/src/codeTypes.ts` and its type-check test; `run_js_code`'s doc comment;
      `docs/TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md` §10.1 (a `fetch` subsection, and the sandbox's "no network"
      line); `docs/tutorial-triggers.md`; CHANGELOG.

## Explicitly OUT of scope for this milestone

- **`fetch`, timers, or any second host surface.** Decision 5. The sandbox gains an event loop
  here and exactly no new capability. *(`fetch` was added afterwards — see the addendum
  above. Timers were not.)*
- **Transactions across statements** (`db.transaction(fn)`). Still its own milestone, and
  multiplexed runs make the case for it no easier: a held transaction across arbitrary guest
  code is a lock held for the run's whole deadline, now with hundreds of runs resident.
- **Preemptive scheduling.** One isolate runs one body's JavaScript at a time; this milestone
  interleaves runs at their `await` points and bounds the slice between them. A body that wants
  CPU parallelism is a body that wants a different tool.
- **Growing or shrinking the pool at runtime.** The pool stays fixed and small (decision 2);
  admission control, not elasticity, is what bounds occupancy.
- **`db` in a formula.** Unchanged: the formula isolate stays pure and synchronous, and the
  deadlock that would follow from giving it a host call is the reason `CodeRuntime` exists.
- **The other guest languages** (§15's Python, Rust, Go adapters). The seam is untouched by
  design (decision 3), which is the point — they inherit this concurrency without inheriting any
  of its plumbing.

---

## Addendum — `fs` in a code body

Added after the `fetch` addendum, at the user's request, and on the same terms: a **third** host
surface, built on the seam the concurrency milestone left behind, with the API agreed before any
of it was written. The shape is between what Bun and Deno do and what this server actually has —
several named stores rather than one filesystem — so `fs(name)` is a store, `open(path)` is a
*reference* (no I/O; the path need not exist), and there is no separate way to create a file
because writing to a reference is one.

- [x] `stat` on the `FileStore` trait (`sc-files`): `FileStat { size, is_dir, modified }`, with a
      **default implementation that lists the parent** — so a backend that can only list still
      answers `exists()` — and a real `metadata` call in `LocalFileStore`, which is the only one
      that can report a modification time. `exists()` had no honest implementation before this:
      `get_meta` answers a default for a file that is not there.
- [x] `FileHost` in `sc-expr`: a third host trait of the same shape as the other two (one JSON
      operation in, one JSON value out), a `files` field on `CodeCall`, `op_sc_files` with a
      budget of its own (`DEFAULT_MAX_FILE_OPS`, 100), and `Surface::Files` on the **existing**
      bridge — so `Promise.all([file.text(), db…])` is served in the one `FuturesUnordered` the
      caller already had. Plus `store_names()`, which is why `fs("typo")` can fail *at once*
      naming the stores that exist: the guest's `fs(name)` is synchronous, so the list travels
      with the run rather than being a call away.
- [x] `FILES_PRELUDE`: `fs`, the file and the directory objects, and the path handling (`..`, an
      absolute path and a null byte are refused in the guest, where the message names the line
      that wrote them, and again in the host, which trusts nothing). Compiled once per isolate;
      `fs` is minted per run by `__scMakeFs(token, stores)` and handed to the body as a
      parameter, exactly as `db` and `fetch` are. The read methods are **not `async`**: an
      `async` function answers a native promise, and the forgotten-`await` guard lives on the
      promise the host call answers — a test caught this, and `[object Promise]` written into a
      file is the failure it would have been.
- [x] `FileStoreHost` in `sc-api::code_host`: the operations over the catalog's connected stores,
      the byte caps (`MAX_FILE_BYTES` 8 MB across the seam, `MAX_COPY_BYTES` 256 MB host-side),
      and §14.1's path-cumulative rule under `asUser()` — with the store floor read once per run
      and skipped entirely under admin authority, where every rule is cleared anyway. One
      decision that is not inherited: a delegated `setMeta` may **tighten** a rule and never
      loosen one.
- [x] Tests: fourteen in `sc-expr` against a fake store (the plan each method builds, `exists`,
      the four write shapes, bytes both ways, a listing walked, a copy and a move, the paths
      refused before they are sent, an unknown store named at once, authority on the handle,
      metadata, the budget, a forgotten `await`, and `fs` absent from a body that was not given
      it) and nine in `sc-core-actions` against **real directories** (read and write, create vs
      write, a directory made/listed/walked/deleted, a cross-store copy, metadata that is the
      store's own, a delegated body refused by a folder rule and by the store's floor while the
      trigger's own authority is not, an over-large file refused rather than truncated, and an
      unconnected store named). Plus two in `sc-files` for `stat` — the local one and the
      default's.
- [x] `ui/admin/src/codeTypes.ts` (`fileDeclarations`, `declare const fs: ScFs`) and its
      type-check test; `run_js_code`'s doc comment; `docs/TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md` §10.1 (an `fs`
      subsection, and the "no disk" line, which is now "no path to a file that is not a store an
      admin connected"); `docs/tutorial-triggers.md`; CHANGELOG.

**Deliberately not in it.** `append` (the trait has none, and a read-modify-write is neither
atomic nor bounded usefully); streaming and partial reads (the seam carries one value, which is
the same limit `res.body` has); a default store (a body that does not name its store breaks when
a second store appears); and any promise about **rollback** — a file a failed trigger wrote stays
written, which the documentation says rather than implies.

## Addendum — `trigger`: running another trigger from a code body

Agreed and implemented after the milestone above, as a fourth host surface beside `db`, `fetch`
and `fs`. `trigger(name)` is a handle, `run(payload)` is the only verb, and what it runs is the
dispatcher's trigger — the same call the Run button makes.

- [x] `sc-expr`: the `TriggerHost` seam (one run in, one value out, plus `trigger_names` for the
      synchronous `trigger(name)`), `CodeCall::triggers` / `max_trigger_runs`
      (`DEFAULT_MAX_TRIGGER_RUNS` = 20), `TRIGGERS_PRELUDE`'s `__scMakeTrigger`, `op_sc_trigger`
      with its own budget and the clock filled in from what is left of the run, the
      `TriggerPromise` guard on a forgotten `await`, and the `wantsTrigger` parameter — so a body
      that was given no dispatcher gets a `ReferenceError` naming `trigger` rather than a call
      that fails.
- [x] `sc-api`: `code_host::TriggerRunHost` over the one `TriggerDispatcher` — the width budget
      counted host-side as well as in the guest, `min_role` enforced under `asUser()` and not
      under the default, the event's caller and chain on the child event, and the run abandoned
      at the parent's deadline.
- [x] `sc-action`: `ActionContext::triggers` and `fire_trigger(&TriggerDispatcher, …)`, which is
      how an action reaches the dispatcher that is running it without an `Arc` cycle.
- [x] `run_js_code` binds it when the context has a dispatcher, carrying the event's role, its
      user and this trigger's chain.
- [x] Tests: eight in `sc-expr` against a fake host, six in `sc-core-actions` against a real
      dispatcher and database, one in the executed tutorial, and one type-check test.
- [x] `ui/admin/src/codeTypes.ts` (`triggerDeclarations`, `declare const trigger: ScTriggers`);
      `run_js_code`'s doc comment; `docs/TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md` §10.1 (a `trigger` subsection);
      `docs/tutorial-triggers.md`; CHANGELOG.

**Deliberately not in it.** Firing an event by kind and channel; fire-and-forget (§18's queue);
a transaction spanning parent and child; and a `run_trigger` action for non-code triggers.
