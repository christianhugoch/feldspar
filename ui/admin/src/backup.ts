// The Backup tab's model: what a backup includes, as data the screen renders and
// the tests can hold.
//
// The screen itself is two buttons and a dialog; what is worth pinning down
// without a browser is the *arithmetic* of the selection, because two rules in it
// are easy to write and easy to get subtly wrong:
//
// - **rows cannot be included without their table's metadata.** The server
//   narrows the payload it is sent (a client bug must not produce rows nothing
//   can read), but a dialog that lets an admin tick a combination the server will
//   quietly drop is a dialog that lies. So unticking a table takes its rows with
//   it, here, in front of them.
// - **the same dialog drives the backup and the restore.** The server describes
//   what is available in one shape whether it comes from this installation or
//   from an uploaded file's manifest, so everything below takes that shape and
//   knows nothing about which it is looking at.
