// Create / edit a trigger: one event bound to a **body** — a configured action
// (§10.2) or a workflow (§10.3).
//
// The point this screen proves is the one the framework and file-store pickers
// prove: **no screen knows a specific action's settings**. The admin picks an
// action and the form renders whatever that action's `config_spec` declares, so
// an action added by a plugin gets a working configuration form with no change
// to this file.
//
// The body is the one choice this form makes that is not about settings: an
// action is configured here, and a workflow is a program drawn on its own canvas
// — so choosing "workflow" replaces the settings half with the way to it, and
// saving lands there. The alternative was a second create screen, which would
// duplicate the event half of this one and then have to keep up with it.
//
// What is *not* generic is the event, and deliberately: which fields apply
// depends on the kind. A table event needs a table and can carry an `only_if`
// over the affected row; every other kind has no row, so both are hidden rather
// than offered and then refused on save. The server validates the same rules —
// this form shapes the question, it does not decide the answer, and a save it
// gets wrong comes back with the server's own message.
