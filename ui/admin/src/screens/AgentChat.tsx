// The chat panel: a transcript, a composer, and the agent's run history (§11.4).
//
// Everything about *what* the transcript is lives in `agentChat.ts` — the
// socket, the event fold, the rebuild of a stored run, the composer's controls
// — and is tested there against a stub. This file is the rendering, which is the
// split that lets the interesting half be tested without a browser.
//
// The screen is the one page in the admin that is not a page of cards, because
// a chat is not a document that scrolls: the transcript scrolls *inside* the
// viewport and the composer never moves, which is the shape every hosted agent
// (Kimi, z.ai, and the rest) has converged on and the shape a long tool-using
// turn needs. The measurements are in `admin.css` under "The agent chat".
//
// What is on screen, and why:
//
//   - **A rail of past conversations**, on the left where a chat interface keeps
//     it, rather than a card beside the transcript: it is navigation between
//     conversations, not part of the one being read. Grouped by age, because a
//     list of forty timestamps is not a list anyone reads.
//   - **The person's messages are bubbles; the agent's are not.** The agent's
//     answer is the content of the page. A border around it is a border around
//     everything, and the asymmetry is what makes the two readable at a glance.
//   - **A tool call is one quiet line**, naming the tool, opening onto its
//     arguments and its result. Collapsed because a transcript is read for what
//     the agent *said*; expandable because when it goes wrong, what it did is
//     the only thing that explains it.
//   - **The composer is a capsule with a toolbar row inside it**, and the
//     toolbar is where a trait's own controls go (`ComposerControl`). Nothing
//     declares one yet; the row exists because a mode that modifies the message
//     being written belongs in the box it is being written in, and retrofitting
//     that means redesigning the composer rather than filling in a slot.
//   - **An old run reopens read-only.** It is a record of what happened, and a
//     composer under it would invite an edit to history. Continuing one is a
//     deliberate act — the Continue button, which reconnects the socket to that
//     run.
//
// The same component is also the **popped-out window** (`chatWindows.ts`): the
// pop-out button in the top right hands the conversation to the store and the
// shell re-renders it in the corner, where the rest of the admin can be
// navigated underneath it. Two renderings of one chat, not two chats: the only
// differences are the chrome (a window's title bar carries minimize / full
// screen / close where the page's carries Back and pop-out) and the rail, which
// a 24rem window has no room for and a full-screen one does.
