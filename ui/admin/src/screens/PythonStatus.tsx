// The Development tab's reading of Python: which state this process is in, and
// the numbers behind it.
//
// It exists because "why does my Python trigger not work" has more than one
// answer and they are not distinguishable from the outside:
//
// - this binary was **built** without Python — no setting changes it, the fix is
//   a different build;
// - it has Python and was started with `--python off` — the fix is a restart;
// - it has Python and has not needed it yet — nothing is wrong;
// - it is running, and then the version is worth having.
//
// So the state is the headline, the server's own sentence sits under it, and
// everything else is only shown when it means something. **The sentence comes
// from the server** (`explanation`): which one is true depends on how the binary
// was built and how the process was started, and only the server knows either.
//
// Nothing here is editable. The two numbers an operator can change are flags
// that need a restart, and a form that pretended otherwise would be worse than
// no form: they are shown with the flag that sets them, which is the actual
// remedy.
