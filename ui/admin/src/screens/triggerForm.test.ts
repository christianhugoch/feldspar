/**
 * Which table the trigger form reads an action's *declaration* for.

 * The screen knows nothing about any particular setting — that is the whole
 * point of `config_spec` — but it does have to ask the right question, because
 * an action may declare different settings for different tables (`send_email`
 * offers one attachment checkbox per File field of the table the trigger fires
 * on). This is that question, and it is a function so it can be pinned without
 * rendering the form.
