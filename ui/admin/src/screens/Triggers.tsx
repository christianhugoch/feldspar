// Triggers list: every stored trigger, what fires it, what it runs, and whether
// it can run at all (§10.2).
//
// Two things this screen exists to make visible, both of them states a list of
// names could not show:
//
//   - A trigger can be **stored but not usable** — its table dropped, its action
//     provided by a plugin that is gone, its formula no longer resolving. It is
//     not in the live set and will not fire, but it is still here, with the
//     reason, and still editable, because editing it is the repair.
//   - A trigger with **no intrinsic event** (`none`) only ever runs because
//     something asks it to, so this is where the asking happens. But every
//     trigger can be **test run** from here, not only that one: a trigger on a
//     table is run against a row picked at random from it, so "does this
//     actually work?" is a question about any row of them rather than a
//     question an admin has to answer by writing a row and watching. What comes
//     back is the result, or the failure, and what a code body **printed** on
//     its way to either — which is the answer to the next question, and the one
//     a hosted deployment has no terminal to read off.
