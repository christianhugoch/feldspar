// The model behind the field editor (design §3.4) — the half of it that is not
// React.
//
// The Fields card on the table page has one modal and does two things with it:
// **add** a field, and **edit** one that exists. They are one form because they
// ask one question — what is this column, and what does it mean? — and because
// two forms would be two places for "a File's parameters live on the kind
// object, not in `attributes`" to be got right or wrong independently.
//
// What the two do *not* share is what they may change. Adding a field writes a
// column: its name and its storage type are decided then. Editing one writes the
// `_fd_fields` overlay (§3.2) — the label, the rich type, the kind and the
// attributes — plus the two column properties an edit may change: whether it is
// in the primary key and whether it accepts nulls. Retyping or renaming a column
// is a migration and a migration framework is out of scope (§3.3), so the form
// disables what an edit cannot carry rather than offering it and losing it.
//
// Everything here is a plain function over plain values, which is what makes the
// round trip — a field as `listFields` reports it, into the form, back out as a
// request that means the same thing — assertable without a browser.
