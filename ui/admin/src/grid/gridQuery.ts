// table — it holds the rows under the viewport. Everything about *which* rows
// those are is arithmetic and string-building over what the header says and what
// the filter row has been typed into, so it lives here rather than in the
// component, where it can be asserted without a browser or a server.
//
// The strings built here are the query string `listRows` and `countRows` take,
// which is the same vocabulary an application's REST read takes
// (`sc_api::query_string`). That is deliberate: the admin grid is not a second
// reader with a second idea of what `gte` means.
