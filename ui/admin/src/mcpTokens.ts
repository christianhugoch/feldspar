// The Development tab's other half: the credentials an external coding agent
// administers this installation with (§13.6).
//
// Kept out of the component for the reason `modules.ts` and `backup.ts` are —
// the arithmetic of the panel is testable without a browser, and the component
// is then only flow. What that arithmetic is, and why each piece of it is here
// rather than inlined:
//
// - **The grant checkboxes are the copilot's own**, fetched from
//   `listAgentTraits` rather than written out here. One vocabulary for "what may
//   this agent do to my installation?" is the whole of §13.6's third decision,
//   and a second copy of six labels in TypeScript is how a vocabulary becomes
//   two. The fallback below exists for the server that has no `admin_copilot`
//   trait registered at all, which is the only case where there is nothing to
//   copy.
// - **The `claude mcp add` line is built here**, from this server's own origin
//   and the token that is still on screen. The setup step that gets typed wrong
//   is the one that is retyped from two places.
// - **A disabled server says so.** Offering to mint a credential that the route
//   will not look at is offering to spend somebody's afternoon.
