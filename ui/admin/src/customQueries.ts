// one: what has to be right is a conversion. A stored `queries` array becomes
// rows an admin can edit and comes back as the same array, and a row becomes the
// body `describeCustomQuery` prepares. Both are testable without a browser
// (`customQueries.test.ts`); what is left in the screen is controls.
//
// **Nothing here decides whether a query is valid.** The name, the path, the
// parameters and the SQL are all judged by the server — the same call a save
// makes, so there is one authority for what a valid query is and the admin never
// sees the form and the server disagree. This module carries the answer to the
// screen; it does not invent one.
