// The Tabler page furniture every admin screen sits in.
//
// Tabler's vertical layout is a fixed shape: a `.page` holding the sidebar and a
// `.page-wrapper`, and inside the wrapper a `.page-header` (title, pre-title,
// actions) followed by a `.page-body` (a `.container-xl` of cards). The header
// is a *sibling* of the body, not a heading inside it — it has its own spacing
// and its own print rules — so a screen renders the two parts itself rather than
// the shell wrapping everything in one container. These two components are that
// contract, in one place, so a screen states its title and its actions and gets
// the same header as every other screen.
//
// `CenteredPage` is the other Tabler page shape: the signed-out one, a narrow
// column centred in the viewport, used by the login and first-user screens.
