// What an application is doing right now: building, having its generated code
// rewritten, and the news the last of those left behind.
//
// Both are started from two places — a row on the applications list and the
// current application's links in the sidebar — and an admin who presses Build in
// the sidebar and then opens the list should see the same build in progress
// there, not a row claiming the app was never built. So the state lives here,
// outside any screen, the way popped-out chats do (`chatWindows.ts`), and a build
// outlives the screen it was started from: it finishes, and says so, wherever the
// admin has got to by then.
//
// The server keeps no persisted build status (design §13.2), so this is the only
// record of one: a freshly loaded app is **not built yet** rather than pretending
// a save deployed anything. As in `chatWindows.ts`, the transitions are pure and
// the store is a thin shell around them, so the interesting part is testable
// without a browser.
