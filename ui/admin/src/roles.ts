// Roles as the admin picks them.
//
// A role is a row in `_sc_roles` (design §7.1, §9) carrying a number on the
// fixed 1–100 scale, a name, and role-specific settings; `users.role` is a
// foreign key onto it. `listRoles` reports what exists, so this module is the
// client half: load the list once per screen, and render a role number as the
// name an admin gave it.
