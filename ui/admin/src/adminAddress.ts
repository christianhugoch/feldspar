// dialog that waits for three things before it lets the admin go there:
//
// 1. the move itself, which the save has already done;
// 2. a certificate naming the new host (`getAdminAddress`'s `certificate`),
//    which under ACME is a minute of traffic with the CA, and under TLS off is
//    nothing at all;
// 3. the new address answering *this browser* — fetched from here, because
//    only the browser can say whether its DNS resolves the name and its trust
//    store accepts the certificate.
//
// Following it does not mean logging in again: the session cookie is
// host-only, so the old host mints a one-time handoff (`createAdminHandoff`)
// that the new host turns into a session.
