/**
 * The Backup tab's model: what the dialog does to a selection.
 *
 * The screen is buttons and a modal, which a browser tests better than a suite
 * does. What can go wrong *silently* is the arithmetic underneath, and two rules
 * in it matter enough to pin down:
 *
 * - rows cannot be included without their table's metadata, and unticking a table
 *   has to take its rows with it — otherwise the dialog shows a selection the
 *   server will narrow behind the admin's back;
 * - the same shape describes what this server has and what an uploaded file has,
 *   so "everything" and the summary line have to work on both without knowing
 *   which they were handed.
