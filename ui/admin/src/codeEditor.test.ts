/**
 * What the code editor does with the language a `code` setting declared.
 *
 * Monaco itself is not testable without a browser — it measures fonts and
 * attaches to a DOM node — but the decision *in front of* it is, and it is the
 * one that goes wrong quietly. Three things ride on it:
 *
 * - a `run_python_code` body must open in an editor that knows Python, not in a
 *   plain box with a JavaScript tokenizer over it;
 * - indentation in Python is **syntax**, so an editor that inserted two spaces
 *   where the author writes four (or a tab) produces a body that does not parse,
 *   and the failure appears at fire time rather than while typing;
 * - the TypeScript worker is a 6 MB script and the declarations it answers from
 *   are JavaScript's, so starting it for a Python body would be a download and a
 *   catalog fetch that can never answer anything.
