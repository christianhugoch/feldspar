// The Views and Pages tabs of a Saltcorn UI application (TODO "Saltcorn UI" 9.2).
//
// Kept out of the component for the reason `modules.ts` and `backup.ts` are: the
// arithmetic of the list is testable without a browser, and the component is
// then only flow. What that arithmetic is:
//
// - **Which tabs an application has.** Only an application whose source is
//   views and pages has the two tabs, and the server says which ones are
//   (`has_views`) — this screen does not know a framework by name.
// - **The link that opens a view on the app's subdomain.** A v1 view name has
//   spaces in it (`List Books`), so the name is encoded into the path; and the
//   generated client interpolates path parameters as they are, so the same
//   encoding is what the API calls are made with (`nameParam`).
// - **A view whose pattern this server does not have** is shown with that fact
//   attached rather than as an ordinary row: it is a view that will not render.
