// An application's Translations screen, as logic (design §16.1, task 4.4).
//
// The screen is one table: a row per message the application's source says, a
// column per locale it serves, and a cell you can type in. Everything here is
// the part of that with an answer worth testing — what a row is, what is
// missing, what the placeholders say, and what a save sends — so `Translations.tsx`
// is a rendering of decisions made in this file.
//
// # The two checks that happen before a save
//
// The server refuses a translation whose placeholders or plural categories
// differ from its key's (D9's guarantee applies to an admin typing one, not
// only to an LLM answering). Doing the same check here is not a duplicate of
// that: it is what lets the cell go red as it is typed, instead of the whole
// save failing with one key named in a sentence. The server remains the
// authority; this is the part that is fast.
