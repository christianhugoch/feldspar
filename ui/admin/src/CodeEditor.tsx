// The code editor a `code` setting is edited in: Monaco, with the sandbox's own
// types loaded.
//
// A `run_js_code` or `run_python_code` body is a program — it declares things,
// loops, branches, and reads and writes tables — and a one-line input or a bare
// text area is the wrong instrument for one. So a setting whose declaration
// names a language (`FormField::code`) gets the editor VS Code is built on, with
// the two things that make writing against `db` possible without the reference
// open in another tab: **highlighting**, and **completions** over this server's
// own tables (`codeTypes.ts` builds the declarations).
//
// **Two languages, and they get different amounts of help** (§12 of the Python
// milestone). Both get a grammar. Only JavaScript gets the completions, because
// the declarations are TypeScript and the thing that answers a question about
// them is the TypeScript worker; the Python counterpart is a generated
// `saltcorn.pyi` and a language server, and neither exists yet. So a Python body
// gets highlighting, its own indentation, and no worker started on its behalf —
// which is honest rather than degraded: what is missing is completion, and
// nothing here pretends to offer it.
//
// Three decisions worth stating:
//
// - **Plain `monaco-editor`, not the workbench.** `ui/ide` embeds VS Code itself
//   (`@codingame/monaco-vscode-api`, §12.1) because a project needs a tree, tabs
//   and a palette. A settings field needs an editor, and the editor is the small
//   half of that package. They are separate bundles, so the two do not meet.
// - **Loaded on demand.** The import is dynamic, so Monaco is a chunk the admin
//   UI fetches when someone opens a code setting, and never on the way to any
//   other screen. If that fetch fails the field falls back to a text area: an
//   admin who cannot load an editor must still be able to fix a trigger.
// - **No diagnostics.** A body is the *inside* of a function — top-level
//   `return` is what the action's docs tell an admin to write — so the parser's
//   "return outside a function" is a false report, and the sandbox is not the
//   browser, so half of what a type-checker would flag is not knowable here
//   anyway. Completions, hovers and signature help are what the types are for;
//   errors come from the Run button, which really runs it.
