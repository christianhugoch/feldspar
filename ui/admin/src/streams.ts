// The streams screens' model: the Observe socket's frame types, and the pure
// functions the list, the form and the Observe screen would otherwise each
// invent (TODO "Streams", task 7.2).
//
// Three of the stream endpoints' fields are declared `json` in the endpoint set
// and therefore arrive as `unknown` in the generated client — the element type,
// the status and the counters. That is right for the *wire*, for the reason it
// is right of a model's outcome: an element type is a provider's vocabulary and
// a status is the supervisor's, neither of which the endpoint set should be
// declaring the shape of. It is wrong for a screen, which has to render them.
// So the shapes are written out here once, as the discriminated unions their
// Rust originals serialise to, and the screens read them through the narrowing
// functions below rather than casting at each use.
//
// The socket's frames are written here too, beside the chat's in `agentChat.ts`
// and for the same reason: `sc-api` generates the typed *request/response*
// client, and a socket has no shape in it (§10). So the four frames of §9 are
// declared by hand, and a Rust test pins the route this file names against the
// one `sc-server` mounts — a page connecting to the wrong path looks exactly
// like a stream that never publishes.
//
// The rest is arithmetic with an opinion:
//
//   - a **status** is four cases and a colour, and `failed` is *yellow* rather
//     than red, because the supervisor is retrying and a stream that will be
//     back in thirty seconds is not the same news as one that cannot be saved;
//   - an **element renders against its declared type**, which is the whole
//     point of declaring one: a table of the declared keys for `json`, the text
//     for `text`, and a hex head for `binary` — never bytes pretended to be
//     characters;
//   - and the **tail is bounded**, because an Observe screen left open on a
//     busy stream would otherwise grow a DOM until the tab dies.
