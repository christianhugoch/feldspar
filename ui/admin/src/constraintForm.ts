// The model behind the constraint editor (design §5) — the half of it that is
// not React.
//
// A table's constraints are four different things wearing one shape: a
// jointly-unique key, an index, a full-text index and a row constraint. They
// share a card and a modal because an admin asks one question of them ("what
// rules does this table keep?"), and they share one request body because the
// endpoint does — the `type` decides which of its fields are read.
//
// What they do not share is what the form asks. Ticking boxes for the fields
// that are unique together, picking one field to index, choosing a language,
// writing a formula: four questions, and the form shows exactly the one that
// belongs to the chosen kind rather than a superset with most of it greyed out.
//
// Everything here is a plain function over plain values, so the round trip — a
// kind and some answers, into a request body, and a listed constraint back into
// a sentence — is assertable without a browser.
