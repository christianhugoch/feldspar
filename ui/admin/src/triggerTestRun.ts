// What a **Test run** of a trigger says afterwards.
//
// The screen's part of a test run is two clicks and a toast; everything between
// them is arithmetic over one response, and it is here so it can be read and
// tested without a browser.
//
// Three things it decides, each of which the toast would otherwise get wrong:
//
//   - **A failure is news, not an error.** `testRunTrigger` answers 200 with
//     `ok: false` when the action failed, because the message *is* the result an
//     admin asked for. Only a request that never reached the action — the server
//     down, the trigger deleted in another tab — is a thrown error, and the two
//     read the same way in the toast.
//   - **The transcript belongs to the failure.** A `run_js_code` that threw on
//     its last line printed everything before it, and that is what says why. So
//     the console lines are shown whichever way the run went, and never
//     collapsed into the result.
//   - **Which row it ran on is part of the answer.** A trigger on `insert`,
//     `update` or `delete` is tested against a row picked at random from its
//     table, so a result that looks wrong is only traceable if the screen says
//     which row produced it — and an empty table is said out loud rather than
//     left to look like a trigger that ignored its row.
