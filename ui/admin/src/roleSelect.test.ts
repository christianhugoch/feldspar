/**
 * Roles are chosen from a list, never typed as a number.
 *
 * Two claims:
 *
 *   - `roleOptions` offers what the server lists, keeps a current role the
 *     server did *not* list, and adds nothing at all for a field with no role
 *     set — the blank's meaning differs per screen, so it is the caller's;
 *   - no screen renders a minimum role as a number box. That is checked against
 *     the sources rather than a rendered form because there is no DOM here, and
 *     the regression it guards against is exactly a hand-written
 *     `<Form.Control type="number">` creeping back into a new screen.
