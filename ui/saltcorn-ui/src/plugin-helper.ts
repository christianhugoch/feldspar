// builder. The vendored file is kept whole and unedited; this module is what
// every import of it reaches — the build redirects the vendored patterns' own
// imports here too, so a refused export is refused inside the bundle as well.
//
// Every upstream export is on **exactly one** of the three lists below, and
// `sc-viewpattern`'s `bundle_shape` test walks the vendored module's exports to
// hold that true after a refresh.
