// The **Saltcorn 1 `Table` and `Field`**, in JavaScript, over the plan seam.
//
// One source, two hosts: this file is compiled into the code isolates beside
// the `db` prelude and concatenated into `sc-module`'s host script, so the
// `Table` a `run_js_code` body gets and the `Table` an installed v1 plugin gets
// are the same text. Two implementations that agreed today would be two
// implementations of v1's `Where` translation, and they would disagree by the
// third bug fixed in one of them.
//
// It is JavaScript for the reason the `db` prelude is: what crosses into Rust
// is a **plan**, so v1's whole `Where` vocabulary, its `selopts` and its
// `joinFields` are lowered *here*, against a seam that resolves every name it is
// handed and trusts none of them. No SQL is assembled anywhere in this file —
// `getJoinedQuery` answers a statement, and even that one is rendered by the
// host out of the plan this file sent it.
//
// # The division
//
// v1's `Table.findOne` is synchronous and eight years of plugins are written
// that way, so **metadata is local and synchronous, data is a host call and
// asynchronous** — which is v1's own division, and is why the port is possible
// at all. The local half is the *schema snapshot*: every table and field this
// catalog has, built by `sc_api::code_host::schema` and handed to the isolate
// before the run starts. Nothing in this file makes a host call to answer a
// property.
//
// # What is here and what throws
//
// Everything this version does not implement is reachable as a property and
// **fatal on call**, naming the path — `NOT_IMPLEMENTED` below is the one place
// that list lives, so a method implemented later is deleted from it in the same
// edit that implements it, and the two can never disagree. A method that
// answered `undefined` would not fail; it would compute the wrong answer inside
// somebody's trigger.
