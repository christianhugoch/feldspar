//! Interpolated templates: a string with `{{ }}` tokens, each token a
//! [`Formula`] (TODO "Email" Phase 1, decision 1).
//!
//! A template is **not a second expression language**. `Template::parse` splits
//! a string into literal runs and tokens and hands every token to
//! [`Formula::parse`], so a subject line, an ownership rule and a trigger's
//! `only_if` are parsed by the same parser, validated against the same
//! [`SchemaShape`], and evaluated by the same [`JsEvaluator`]. The consequences
//! are the point: a template that names a field which does not exist is refused
//! **on save**, in front of the admin; its free variables come out of the
//! ordinary [`Analysis`], so `{{ customerⱵemail }}` is prefetched by the same
//! `prefetch_bindings` that resolves a Ⱶ-path anywhere else.
//!
//! # The three sigils
//!
//! Saltcorn 1's, kept exactly, because a v1 application's templates are the
//! corpus this has to accept:
//!
//! - `{{ x }}` — the value, HTML-escaped when the template renders as HTML.
//! - `{{! x }}` — the value, never escaped: the token that holds markup.
//! - `{{= x }}` — the value, **re-interpolated** in the same scope, so a field
//!   holding `"Hello {{ firstName }}!"` renders as a template of its own.
//!
//! The sigil is the character immediately after `{{`, which is what makes
//! `{{ !x }}` the negation it looks like rather than a raw token.
//!
//! # Two deliberate departures from v1
//!
//! - **Re-interpolation is bounded** ([`MAX_PASSES`]). v1's is not, so a row
//!   whose field holds `{{= self }}` renders forever; here the bound is hit and
//!   the error names the template.
//! - **A missing binding is an error, not an empty string.** v1 evaluates a
//!   token in a sandbox where an unknown name is `undefined`; here every name
//!   was classified against the schema when the template was saved, so an
//!   unresolvable name at render time means the schema changed underneath —
//!   which this system reports rather than absorbs. A **null column value** is
//!   still the empty string: that is data, not a mistake.
//!
//! # Escaping is a property of the render
//!
//! [`render_html`](Template::render_html) escapes bare tokens;
//! [`render_text`](Template::render_text) does not. A subject line put through
//! the HTML rule turns `Tea & Coffee` into `Tea &amp; Coffee`, and a
//! `text/plain` body becomes a page of entities — so a recipient list, a subject
//! and a text body render as text while an HTML body renders as HTML. `{{! }}`
//! and `{{= }}` mean the same in both.
