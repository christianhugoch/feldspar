//! How a **row action's** formulas are run: over which rows, with which values,
//! and under whose authority.
//!
//! The scope rule itself, the configuration parsers and the event's bindings live
//! one layer down, in `sc-action` — they are the same for every action, including
//! [`Fetch`](crate::Fetch) beside these. What is *here* is what only an action that
//! reads and writes a table needs:
//!
//! - **The bare scope is the target table's row.** `status === "draft"` is the row
//!   being written and `row.status` is the event's; an `insert_row` value has no
//!   such row and is read in `sc_action::EVENT_SCOPE` instead.
//! - **Values are typed by their columns**, not merely by their JSON shape, so an
//!   inlined `user.id` is a uuid a `uuid` column can be compared against in SQL.
//!   (Reified evaluation cannot tell the difference — this is for the translated
//!   path.)
//! - **The `where` predicate's two strategies**, and the per-row prefetching each
//!   matched row needs.
//!
//! ## Authority
//!
//! An action's writes are the *admin's*, not the caller's: a trigger is
//! server-side configuration, and an audit row a user may not insert is the
//! archetype of what a trigger exists to write. So every write runs as a caller
//! at [`ROLE_ADMIN`] (which clears every policy's role floor, exactly as the
//! admin API's own row editor does), still carrying the event's user so a policy
//! that reads `user` sees who caused it.
//!
//! On an RLS-enforced table that caller becomes the `SET LOCAL` GUCs the policies
//! read; off one it sets nothing and the write takes the ordinary pooled path,
//! but it still travels — because the **event** this write raises has to say who
//! caused it, and it carries the **chain** of triggers that led here, which is
//! what lets `Event::firing` see how deep a cascade already is (§10.2).
