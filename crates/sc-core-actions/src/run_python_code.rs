/// Run a configured Python body in this server's embedded interpreter, and
/// return what it returns.
///
/// The same action as [`RunJsCode`](crate::RunJsCode) in a second language, and
/// that is not a figure of speech: the same two settings, the same default and
/// ceiling on the timeout, the same scope rule, the same five host surfaces
/// built from the same context, and the same plans crossing the same seam. What
/// differs is the spelling — and one deep thing, below.
///
/// ## Nothing is awaited
///
/// A Python body is **synchronous**, top to bottom: a terminal answers its rows,
/// not a future.
///
/// ```python
/// overdue = (db.invoices
///     .where(paid=False, due__lt=payload["today"])
///     .select("id", "amount", "customerⱵemail")
///     .order_by("due")
///     .limit(50)
///     .rows())
///
/// for inv in overdue:
///     db.reminders.insert(invoice=inv["id"], sent_to=inv["customerⱵemail"])
///
/// return {
///     "chased": len(overdue),
///     "owed": db.invoices.where(paid=False).sum("amount"),
/// }
/// ```
///
/// That is deliberate rather than a simplification. The overwhelming majority of
/// Python an app builder will paste in — a `csv` walk, a `re` parse, a
/// `statistics` call, a model's `predict` — is synchronous, and an `async def`
/// body would tax every one of them for a concurrency Python authors do not
/// expect at this size. It costs nothing in throughput: a synchronous body
/// **already runs concurrently with every other one**, because a host call
/// releases the GIL and a run is an ordinary Python thread. What it costs is a
/// thread per resident run instead of a pending promise, which is 34–42 KB.
///
/// ## What is in scope
///
/// `row`, `old`, `user` and `payload`, under the rule the JavaScript body and the
/// formula scope follow: **presence is scope**. `row` and `old` exist exactly
/// where the event has rows, so naming `row` in a `login` trigger's body is a
/// `NameError` rather than a silent `None`; `old` on an insert is in scope *and*
/// `None`; `user` is the caller's fields as a `dict`, or `None`. `payload` is
/// what a directly-run or scheduled trigger was called with. `context` is bound
/// when the body is a workflow step, and not otherwise.
///
/// And the host surfaces this server has, each bound only where it has one — so
/// naming `fs` on a server with no file stores is a `NameError` naming it rather
/// than a call that fails later. `db` lands here; `fetch`, `fs`, `trigger` and
/// `modfn` are phase 3. They are injected into the body's globals, and
/// `import saltcorn` reaches the same objects for code that would rather be
/// explicit.
///
/// JSON in, JSON out: an object is a `dict`, an array a `list`, `null` is `None`,
/// and a date is an ISO string because that is what the row layer put on the
/// wire. Coming back, `datetime`, `date`, `time`, `Decimal` and `UUID` are
/// converted; anything else that has no JSON form is an error naming the type
/// and the path to it, rather than a `null` in somebody's workflow context.
///
/// ## `db`
///
/// `db.invoices` is a table and `db.table("customer orders")` is the same thing
/// for a name that is not an identifier. Chain methods are pure and cheap —
/// they build a plan and touch nothing — and terminals execute. A filter is
/// keywords (`paid=False`, `due__lt=today`), the object DSL every other surface
/// speaks, or a formula string; several of them, and several `.where()` calls,
/// are ANDed. `.iter()` walks more rows than one read may answer, one host call
/// per batch, and iterating the query itself is the same thing:
///
/// ```python
/// for book in db.books.where(pages__gt=100).order_by("title"):
///     ...
/// ```
///
/// The body's own SQL is `db.sql("select … where pages > $1", [200])`, with the
/// same admission and the same consequences the JavaScript one carries: the text
/// is the author's and runs as written, the values are binds and never part of
/// it, no ownership formula filters it, and a write inside one raises no table
/// event.
///
/// ## Whose authority, and what bounds it
///
/// Unchanged, because it is the same host: reads and writes are the **admin's**
/// by default, carrying the event's user, and `db.as_user()` delegates to the
/// event's caller, where §7.3's ownership rule decides every row. A refusal is an
/// ordinary catchable exception at the call site — `saltcorn.DbError` — so a body
/// may try a delegated write and fall back. Every budget is the JavaScript body's
/// (1000 rows per read, 200 database calls per run, …) with the same refusal
/// sentences, because they are bounds on what the *host* is asked to do.
///
/// Two bounds are Python's own and worth an author's attention. `saltcorn.Timeout`
/// derives from `BaseException`, so a bare `except Exception:` in a retry loop
/// cannot swallow the run's deadline. And a body inside a C call — `numpy` on a
/// large array — cannot be interrupted at all: the deadline still answers the
/// trigger's caller, but the thread is quarantined and counted, and the remedy
/// for an accumulation of them is a restart. There is **no memory bound**: CPython
/// has no equivalent of a V8 heap limit.
///
/// ## The three states of Python in a server
///
/// This action is registered whether or not this binary has an interpreter linked
/// in, so a trigger's configuration stays meaningful across deployments and an
/// admin gets a sentence naming the reason rather than a missing action. Which of
/// the three states — not built with Python, built but not yet initialised, or
/// running — is the adapter's own answer, and the message a body gets when there
/// is no interpreter comes from there rather than from here.
