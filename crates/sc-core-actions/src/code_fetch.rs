//! The network a **code body** reaches through `fetch` (§10.1).
//!
//! [`sc_expr::FetchHost`] implemented over the same `reqwest` client the
//! [`Fetch`](crate::Fetch) action uses, because it is the same capability
//! reached two ways: an admin who can configure a `fetch` action can write a
//! `run_js_code` body, and a trigger body is server-side configuration either
//! way. What the body gains over the action is the thing a body exists for —
//! the response is a value it can branch on, loop over and write to a table.
//!
//! The rules are the action's, kept deliberately identical so there is one
//! answer to "what can a trigger send":
//!
//! - **absolute `http`/`https` only** — a relative URL has nothing to resolve
//!   against server-side, and `file:`/`data:` would make the server read
//!   something local, which is not what "call an endpoint" means;
//! - **the request is re-validated here**, not trusted from the guest. The
//!   prelude checks a header name so the *message* can name the line that wrote
//!   it; this checks it again because the guest is where the admin's own
//!   JavaScript runs and the seam is a boundary, not a formality;
//! - **bounded**: the wall clock arrives already clamped to what is left of the
//!   run (`sc_expr` does that), and the response is capped at
//!   [`MAX_RESPONSE_BYTES`] — refused rather than truncated, for the reason a
//!   read of 1000 rows is refused rather than truncated: half a body computed
//!   against is a wrong answer that looks like a right one.
//!
//! What is deliberately *not* here is any notion of which hosts may be called.
//! A code body is administrator-authored configuration running on the server,
//! exactly as the `fetch` action is, so the network it can reach is the network
//! the server can reach. A deployment that needs less than that has a firewall,
//! which is where that rule belongs and where it cannot be argued with.
