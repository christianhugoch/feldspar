/// Run a configured JavaScript body in the server's sandboxed engine, and return
/// what it returns.
///
/// ## What is in scope
///
/// `row`, `old`, `user` and `payload` — the same rule the formula scope follows
/// (decision 7), so a trigger's `only_if` and its code see the same world: `row`
/// and `old` exist exactly where the event has rows, so naming `row` in a `login`
/// trigger's code is a `ReferenceError` rather than a silent `undefined`; `old` on
/// an insert is in scope *and null*; `user` is the caller's fields or `null`.
/// `payload` is the addition: it is what a directly-run or scheduled trigger was
/// called with, the formula language has no way to reach it, and a `none`
/// trigger's code is exactly what wants it.
///
/// And five host surfaces: `db`, the **tables**, read and written from the body
/// (§10.1's `db`); `fetch`, an **HTTP request**; `fs`, the **file stores**;
/// `trigger`, this server's **other triggers**; and `modfn`, the **functions
/// this server's modules supply** (all below).
///
/// ```js
/// const html = await modfn.md_to_html(row.notes);
/// const lat = await modfn("@saltcorn/nominatim-geocode").geocode_lat({ city: row.city });
/// ```
///
/// A module function is v1's own, and it runs on the isolate its module was
/// loaded on — which is where the `markdown-it`, the geocoder and the module's
/// configuration are. Everything is awaited, including the ones that are
/// synchronous in v1, and `modfn` is bound only where this server has modules.
///
/// ```js
/// const overdue = await db.invoices
///   .where({ paid: false, due: { lt: payload.today } })
///   .select("id", "amount", "customerⱵemail", { chased: "remindersↃinvoice.length" })
///   .orderBy("due")
///   .limit(50)
///   .rows();
/// for (const inv of overdue) {
///   await db.reminders.insert({ invoice: inv.id, sent_to: inv.customerⱵemail });
/// }
/// return {
///   chased: overdue.length,
///   owed: await db.invoices.where({ paid: false }).sum("amount"),
/// };
/// ```
///
/// A chain is pure and a terminal executes, sending one plan to
/// [`sc_api::code_host::TableHost`] — which resolves every table, column, Ⱶ-path
/// and formula through the catalog, so nothing a chain produces reaches SQL as
/// text. Writes go through the row layer, which means they are coerced against
/// their columns, validated, and **observed by triggers**: a write from a code
/// body is an event like any other, carrying this trigger's chain, so the cascade
/// bound applies to it exactly as it does to `insert_row`.
///
/// ## The body's own SQL
///
/// For the question the chain does not ask — a window function, a recursive CTE,
/// an `ON CONFLICT` — there is `db.sql`:
///
/// ```js
/// const ranked = await db.sql(
///   "select owner, title, rank() over (partition by owner order by pages desc) as r \
///    from books where pages > $1",
///   [200],
/// );
/// const mine = await db.sql("select * from books", [], { asUser: true });  // or db.asUser().sql(…)
/// ```
///
/// The text is the trigger author's and runs as written; the values are
/// **binds** and never part of it. It is the same admission §13.4's custom SQL
/// queries are — a code body is server-side configuration written by an
/// administrator — and it carries the same consequences, which the third
/// argument is an object in order to keep saying: raw SQL does not go through
/// the row layer, so no ownership formula filters it, no rich type coerces it,
/// and **a write inside one raises no table event**. The row cap, the call
/// budget and the caller-context transaction (so an RLS table's policies still
/// decide) all still apply.
///
/// ## Calling an endpoint
///
/// `fetch` is the web's, with the web's rules — an author who already knows a
/// browser knows this one:
///
/// ```js
/// const res = await fetch("https://api.example.com/rates", {
///   headers: { authorization: `Bearer ${payload.token}` },
/// });
/// if (!res.ok) throw new Error(`rates: ${res.status}`);
/// const { usd } = await res.json();
/// await db.invoices.where({ id: row.id }).update({ rate: usd });
/// ```
///
/// A status the endpoint did not like is **not** an error: `res.ok` is false
/// and nothing throws, so the retry or the fallback is written in the body
/// rather than being a trigger that failed. Only a transport failure rejects,
/// with a `TypeError`, as a browser does. `Headers` and `Response` are there;
/// what is not is streaming (`res.body`), because the seam carries one value,
/// and `AbortSignal`, because there are no timers in the sandbox — the bound
/// that matters is already the run's own clock, which every request is clamped
/// to. One difference from the web is deliberate: an object body is sent as
/// JSON, because `[object Object]` on the wire is a bug every time it happens.
///
/// It is the same capability the [`Fetch`](crate::Fetch) action is, reached the
/// other way and bounded the same: absolute `http`/`https` only, 50 requests per
/// run, at most 8 MB of response, and each request clamped to what is left of
/// the body's `timeout_ms` — so a hung endpoint fails inside the body, where it
/// can be caught, rather than holding the trigger's caller.
///
/// ## Reading and writing files
///
/// `fs(name)` is a **file store**, `open` is a reference to a path in it — no
/// I/O, and the path need not exist — and everything that touches bytes is a
/// method on that reference:
///
/// ```js
/// const theFile = fs("myFileStore").open("the_file.txt");
/// if (await theFile.exists()) {
///   const rows = (await theFile.text()).split("\n");
///   await fs("myFileStore").open("reports/summary.json").write({ rows: rows.length });
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Creating is not a second concept: a reference that can be read can be
/// written, and the parent directories are made on the way. `write` replaces
/// what is there, `create` refuses to, and both take a string, bytes, a
/// `Response` (so `await file.write(await fetch(url))` saves a download),
/// another file (copied host-side, so the bytes never enter the sandbox), or any
/// other value — which is stored as JSON, for the reason `fetch`'s object body
/// is sent as JSON.
///
/// The reading vocabulary is a `Response`'s — `text()`, `json()`, `bytes()`,
/// `arrayBuffer()` — so an author who has read a fetch response has read a file.
/// The one departure from a `Blob` is that `size` and `type` are part of
/// `await file.stat()` rather than properties, because there is no synchronous
/// I/O in the sandbox and a property that lies is worse than an await. A missing
/// file is `await file.exists() === false`, and an error only to something that
/// was told to read it.
///
/// Directories are the same shape: `fs(s).dir("notes")` has `list()` — which
/// answers the same file and directory objects, so a listing is walked and acted
/// on rather than read and re-opened by name — `create()`, `exists()` and
/// `delete()`. A file also has `delete()`, `moveTo(dest)`, `copyTo(dest)` (where
/// `dest` may be a file in **another** store), and `meta()` / `setMeta()` over
/// the store's own per-file metadata — which is where §14.1's `min_role` rule is
/// set, and is reported as both what is set on the entry and what actually
/// applies given every directory above it.
///
/// Bounded like the other two: 100 file operations per run, 8 MB across the seam
/// per read and per write — **refused rather than truncated**, since a body
/// handed the first 8 MB of a larger file would compute a wrong answer out of a
/// right-looking one — and 256 MB per copy, which never crosses the seam at all.
/// Two things a body should not assume: nothing streams, and **a file write is
/// not rolled back** by a trigger that throws afterwards.
///
/// ## Running another trigger
///
/// `trigger(name)` is a handle over one of this server's triggers — no dispatch,
/// and `run` is the only verb:
///
/// ```js
/// const archived = await trigger("archive_done").run({ before: payload.today });
/// await trigger("reindex").run();                      // no payload is {}
/// await trigger("send_invoice").asUser().run({ id: row.id });
/// ```
///
/// It runs **the dispatcher's trigger, not a copy of it**: the same call the Run
/// button, `POST {mount}/actions/{name}` and the scheduler make, so the target's
/// `only_if` runs (and `null` comes back when it declines), a disabled trigger
/// stays disabled, one that failed validation says why, and the **cascade bound**
/// counts this run. That last is what makes the recursion safe rather than merely
/// unlikely: the child event carries this trigger's chain, so a body that runs
/// the trigger it is itself the action of stops at `MAX_DEPTH` with the whole
/// chain named. A failing trigger is an ordinary catchable error, so a body may
/// run one and fall back.
///
/// A handle rather than `db.books`'s property access, because a trigger's name is
/// the admin's own words for it; and the names travel into the run, so a typo is
/// refused where it is written, naming the triggers that do exist.
///
/// Bounded like the others: 20 trigger runs per body — the *width* of a cascade,
/// where the chain bounds its depth — and each one clamped to what is left of
/// this body's `timeout_ms`, so a slow child fails inside the body that started
/// it rather than holding the request that fired the outermost trigger.
///
/// ## Whose authority
///
/// Reads and writes — of tables and of files alike — are the **admin's** by
/// default, carrying the event's user —
/// a trigger is server-side configuration, and an audit row the caller may not
/// insert is the archetype of what a trigger exists to write. `db.asUser()`
/// delegates to the event's caller instead, and then §7.3's ownership rule
/// decides every row; a refusal is a catchable error, so a body may try a
/// delegated write and fall back. `fs(name).asUser()` is the same move for
/// files, where what decides is §14.1's path-cumulative rule instead — the
/// store's floor, then every directory on the path, then the entry itself, most
/// restrictive winning — and where a delegated body may **tighten** an access
/// rule with `setMeta` but never loosen one. `trigger(name).asUser()` is the
/// same move again, and there what decides is the target's own `min_role`: under
/// the trigger's own authority no floor is consulted, because running a trigger
/// from a trigger is configuration calling configuration. What does **not**
/// depend on the authority is who the child event says caused it — the event's
/// role and user travel either way, so the trigger that runs sees the same
/// `user` it would have seen had that caller run it directly. On a `db.sql` it
/// means less, and honestly so:
/// the statement runs at the caller's role and user, which is what row-level
/// security reads, and an ownership formula does not reach it.
///
/// The escape hatch for the thing an elementary action cannot anticipate: a
/// computation over the event, its tables and what an endpoint says that no
/// combination of `insert_row`/`fetch` and formulas expresses. It is still
/// bounded — no subprocess, no schema changes, no transactions across
/// statements, no path to a file except through a store an admin connected, and
/// nine named bounds (1000 rows per read, 200 database calls per run, 50
/// fetches per run, 100 file operations per run, 20 trigger runs per run, 8 MB
/// per response, 8 MB per file read or written, the `timeout_ms` wall clock, and
/// one second of JavaScript at a time without awaiting anything — a body shares
/// its isolate with every other body, and the sharing works because a body
/// awaiting a query leaves it free). A table larger than one read is walked with
/// `.iter()`, which yields the same rows a batch at a time — one database call
/// each, so what bounds it is the call budget rather than the row cap.
///
/// Three consequences of the runtime, all deliberate:
///
/// - a code body runs on the **code** isolate pool, not the formula isolate a
///   `only_if` or an ownership formula uses. Which is why the timeout here is
///   configurable at all: a bound on a pool nothing else depends on is not a
///   bound on every authorization decision in the process;
/// - the code is **asynchronous**: every terminal answers a promise, `.iter()` is
///   walked with `for await`, and `await` is legal at the top level of a body,
///   which is the inside of an `async function`. A `Promise.all([…])` of two
///   queries really does issue them together. The chain itself stays synchronous
///   — `await` goes at the front of a whole chain, never inside one — and a
///   forgotten `await` is a named error rather than `{}` in the result, because
///   the promise a terminal answers refuses to be stringified, coerced or
///   iterated. `db`, `fetch`, `fs` and `trigger` are the four awaitable things
///   there are — no timers, no second way to the network, no path to the disk
///   that is not a store an admin connected — and the one shape the
///   runtime refuses outright is a body that computes for a second without
///   yielding, because that is the isolate held against every other trigger;
/// - a **syntax error surfaces at fire time**, not on save. Checking it would
///   mean compiling in the engine, which the save path has no access to — an
///   admin tests a body with the Run button, as they would with any code.
