//! What the two code-body actions have in common, which is everything but the
//! language.
//!
//! `run_js_code` and `run_python_code` are the same action twice: the same two
//! settings, the same default and the same ceiling on the timeout, the same
//! scope rule for what the event binds, and the same five host surfaces built
//! from the same [`ActionContext`]. The only differences are which engine runs
//! the source and what the editor is told to highlight.
//!
//! So it is one implementation with the language as an argument, rather than two
//! that have to be kept in step. That is not tidiness: the two languages
//! agreeing about authority, budgets and events is the property TODO §2 is
//! after, and a second copy of `bindings` is exactly how a body would come to
//! see `payload` in one language and not the other.
