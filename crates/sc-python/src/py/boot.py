"""The Python half of the body pipeline (TODO "The Python code adapter" §3).

Three things live here rather than in Rust, and each for the same reason: they
are `ast`, `linecache` and `traceback` calls, and writing them through the C
API would be a transliteration nobody could read.

- ``compile_body`` — the author's source, parsed and *moved* into a
  ``FunctionDef`` rather than re-indented into one. That is what makes ``return``
  legal at the top level while leaving every line number where the author put
  it, including inside a triple-quoted string and inside a nested ``def``.
- ``execute`` — run one compiled body and answer what it returned.
- ``format_error`` — a failure rendered as the author's own frames and nothing
  else: a body that divides by zero should say ``line 7, in <body>``, not
  fifteen frames of runtime.

Nothing here is a security boundary. It is imported once, at interpreter start,
under a module name a body has no reason to touch; a body that reaches into it
anyway is the same body that can reach ``().__class__.__mro__``, which §10 of
the specification says out loud rather than pretending otherwise.
