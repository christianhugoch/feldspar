//! **The Python code adapter**: a code body — and a plugin module — run on one
//! embedded CPython, over `sc-expr`'s own [`CodeCall`] and its five host traits
//! (design §15; TODO "The Python code adapter").
//!
//! ```python
//! overdue = db.invoices.where(paid=False).order_by("due").limit(50).rows()
//! for inv in overdue:
//!     db.reminders.insert(invoice=inv["id"])
//! return {"chased": len(overdue)}
//! ```
//!
//! That surface is Python — `src/py/saltcorn.py`, shipped inside the binary and
//! installed on the meta path at interpreter start — and it lowers to the same
//! plans a JavaScript body's terminals lower to. All five are here: `db`,
//! `fetch` (shaped like `requests`), `fs`, `trigger` and `modfn`, each bound
//! into a run's globals only where this server has the surface behind it.
//! Underneath them is everything this crate began as: one interpreter, a run per
//! thread, the four bounds, and the seam.
//!
//! The same five are what an installed **plugin module** reaches ([`pymodule`]):
//! a `pip`-installable distribution that declares an action, a function and a
//! table provider with decorators, loaded into the same interpreter and answering
//! the same `sc_module` types the other language's modules answer — one
//! `_sc_modules`, one Modules tab, one action registry.
//!
//! # Why there is nothing new below the plans
//!
//! [`CodeCall`] was never JavaScript's. The source, the bindings, the five
//! borrowed host handles and the six budgets are the same question in any
//! language, so a second language is a second implementation of
//! [`CodeAdapter`] and **nothing else** — no second call type, no second host
//! trait, and therefore no way for two languages to drift apart about authority,
//! budgets or events. `ctx.adapter("python")` is how an action reaches this one.
//!
//! # The three states of Python in a server, which are not the same question
//!
//! | | what it is | how it changes |
//! | --- | --- | --- |
//! | `python-host` | a **Cargo feature** on this crate: links `libpython` in | a rebuild |
//! | `--python off\|auto` | a CLI flag (phase 2.5): whether this process *starts* the interpreter it has | a restart |
//! | started | whether a body or a module has actually needed it yet | the first Python trigger |
//!
//! PyO3 embeds CPython by **linking** it, so the feature is the whole of the
//! first decision: there is no flag that turns Python on in a binary built
//! without it. And the feature is **off by default**, for a reason phase 0
//! sharpened: this project's shipped artifact is a `+crt-static` static-PIE
//! binary, and the Python link does not succeed under `+crt-static` at all — nor
//! could an embedded interpreter `dlopen` the C extensions (`numpy` above all)
//! that are the point of having it. So the shipped tarball has no Python and a
//! Python-capable server is a separate, dynamically-linked build, which needs
//! `libpython3.x.so` present on the host to exec at all.
//!
//! A build **without** the feature still constructs a [`PythonRuntime`] and
//! still registers `run_python_code`, and every entry point answers "this server
//! was built without Python support". That is deliberate: a trigger's
//! configuration stays meaningful across deployments, and an admin gets a
//! sentence naming the reason instead of a missing action.
//! [`PythonRuntime::state`] is the same three states, for the screen that has to
//! show which one this process is in.
//!
//! # What one interpreter gives, and what it does not
//!
//! Concurrency, and not isolation. Every host call releases the GIL, so a run
//! waiting on a query holds a thread and not the interpreter and every other run
//! executes while it waits — measured, not asserted: eight runs each making one
//! 2 000 ms host call finish in 2 003 ms, against 16 013 ms for the same eight
//! with the GIL held (phase 0.2). Two **CPU-bound** bodies do serialise, with
//! about 35% of contention on top, and nothing in this milestone changes that.
//!
//! Isolation is separate globals, separate thread state and one shared
//! `sys.modules`: a body that mutates a module it imported has mutated it for
//! the next body. That is what one interpreter can give, it is said here rather
//! than discovered, and per-plugin subinterpreters are the version of "more
//! than one" worth having later.
//!
//! # What a body may import, and what the gate is worth
//!
//! `src/py/gate.py` gives every run a `__builtins__` whose `__import__` refuses
//! the standard-library modules that reach the process, the network and the
//! disk, and refuses `os.environ` while leaving `os.path`. Everything else —
//! the rest of the standard library, and every package installed in this
//! server's Python environment — is allowed.
//!
//! It is **hygiene, not privilege**, and this crate says so everywhere rather
//! than in one place: `builtins.open` exists, `().__class__.__mro__` exists, and
//! `importlib` is refused by name rather than made unreachable. What the gate
//! buys is that `import subprocess` is a mistake shaped like an `ImportError` on
//! the line that made it. The real bound is the one `db.sql` and installing a
//! module already have — authoring a trigger body is an administrator's
//! capability — and §10 of the specification is that there is no sandbox in
//! either language's modules either.
//!
//! # The pieces
//!
//! - [`interp`] — the interpreter, the boot module, the surface, the body cache.
//! - `gate` (Python) — the import gate, and the `os` a body sees.
//! - [`bridge`] — the five host functions, the GIL release, the budgets.
//! - [`convert`] — JSON ↔ Python, and what has no JSON form.
//! - [`errors`] — the exception hierarchy, defined in Rust.
//! - [`runtime`] — the thread cache, the admission bound and the four bounds.
//! - [`pymodule`] — plugin modules: the host, the loaded set, and what a
//!   distribution supplies.
