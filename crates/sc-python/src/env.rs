//! **The Python environment**: one virtual environment this server owns, and
//! `pip` (specification §9; TODO phase 5).
//!
//! ```text
//! <--python-dir>/pyvenv.cfg                        # written by `python3 -m venv`
//! <--python-dir>/bin/python                        # the interpreter pip runs under
//! <--python-dir>/lib/python3.x/site-packages/…     # what pip put there, and what
//!                                                  # `interp::isolate_path` puts on sys.path
//! ```
//!
//! Everything here is a **subprocess**, so none of it is behind the
//! `python-host` feature: creating an environment, installing into it and
//! listing what is there are the same acts whether or not this binary has an
//! interpreter linked in. That matters for the screen — the Modules tab asks
//! [`have_python`] and [`have_pip`] the way it already asks `have_npm`, and a
//! build without the feature must be able to answer.
//!
//! # The trap this module exists to close
//!
//! `pip` runs under an **external** interpreter (`--python-bin`, default
//! `python3`) and the code runs under the **embedded** one, which PyO3 linked
//! in. They are not the same program and they need not be the same version. A
//! pure-Python package does not care; a C extension built for 3.12 and imported
//! into 3.11 is a **segfault**, not an `ImportError` — the server goes down and
//! the crash is attributed to whatever ran next. So every path into the
//! environment goes through [`PythonEnvironment::ensure`], which compares the
//! two and refuses with both versions named ([`abi_refusal`]), and the boot
//! path makes the same comparison against an environment that already exists
//! before it puts anything on `sys.path`.
//!
//! # What an install is
//!
//! `pip install <specifier>` for a `pypi` module and `pip install <directory>`
//! for a local one — a **copy**, not `-e`, for the reason npm's
//! `--install-links` is used for JavaScript locals: an editable install is a
//! pointer at a checkout, and a checkout that moves or changes under a running
//! server is a module that stops being the one that was installed. Pressing
//! Install again is how a local package is updated.
//!
//! **What was installed is read from pip**, never from what the admin typed: a
//! specifier may carry a version or an extra (`httpx[http2]>=0.27`) and a
//! directory says its name only in its own metadata. `pip install --report`
//! writes exactly that — the requested distribution's name and version, as pip
//! resolved them — and where a pip too old to write one leaves nothing, the
//! answer is recovered by diffing the environment across the install.
