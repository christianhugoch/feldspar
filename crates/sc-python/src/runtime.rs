//! A run is a thread, admission is a number, and the caller serves the host.
//!
//! # A run is a thread, and threads are cheap
//!
//! A Python body is synchronous top to bottom — that is the surface's one deep
//! difference from the JavaScript one — so a run in a host call costs a thread
//! rather than a pending promise. Phase 0.2a measured what that is worth:
//! 34–42 KB per resident run, so the whole default admission budget of 32 is
//! about a megabyte, and the interpreter hosting them is less than half of one
//! V8 isolate. A finished thread goes back in an idle cache rather than being
//! reaped, so a trigger firing a thousand times spawns roughly as many threads
//! as it ever runs at once.
//!
//! # One admission bound over everything
//!
//! [`DEFAULT_MAX_INFLIGHT`](crate::DEFAULT_MAX_INFLIGHT) runs may be resident at
//! once — code bodies and **plugin module** calls alike ([`Task`]), because
//! there is one interpreter and one thing being bounded. Past it a run queues **inside its own deadline**, which
//! is why the wait is a timeout and not a park.
//!
//! With one exception, and it is not a convenience (§6). A Python body may run a
//! trigger whose action is another Python body; if enough of those are in
//! flight, every admitted run waits for a slot held by a run waiting for it.
//! That deadlock only appears under load, so a run **nested inside another
//! Python run** is admitted past the bound on a thread of its own. It is safe
//! because the parent is blocked in a host call with the GIL released — nesting
//! adds threads, not interpreter contention — and because the cascade bound
//! already bounds how many there can be. Nesting is known from a task-local this
//! module sets while it serves a host call, so nothing has to be threaded
//! through the seam.
//!
//! # Who serves the host calls
//!
//! The future that is awaiting the run. The hosts on a [`CodeHosts`] are
//! *borrowed*, and the borrow lives exactly as long as the future holding it —
//! so the plans travel back here over a channel and are answered here, rather
//! than anything `'static` being manufactured to cross to the thread.
//!
//! # The four bounds, in the order they fire
//!
//! 1. **The host refuses** every call once the deadline has passed, and bounds
//!    the call *already in flight* by what is left of the clock ([`crate::bridge`]).
//! 2. **`SetAsyncExc`** raises `Timeout` in the run's thread, which stops any
//!    pure-Python loop within a few milliseconds.
//! 3. **The caller stops waiting** at the deadline plus [`CALLER_GRACE`] and
//!    answers with the timeout, whatever the thread is doing.
//! 4. **The thread is quarantined**: dropped from the idle cache, counted as
//!    stuck, and reported. Past [`DEFAULT_MAX_STUCK`] new runs are refused with
//!    a named error rather than accumulating threads that will never come back —
//!    a quarantined thread is a leak, it is reported as one, and the remedy is a
//!    restart. A thread that *does* come back stops being counted and goes back
//!    to work.
//!
//! There is no memory bound. A V8 isolate has a heap limit and a near-limit
//! callback; CPython has neither, and `RLIMIT_AS` is process-wide, which would
//! take the server down instead of the body. Said here, and in the documentation
//! beside the timeout, rather than discovered in production.
