//! The seam: five functions in one extension module, each taking a plan and
//! answering one JSON value.
//!
//! ```text
//! __sc_db(plan) · __sc_fetch(request) · __sc_fs(op) · __sc_trigger(request)
//! __sc_modfn(request) · __sc_names(kind)
//! ```
//!
//! The sixth is not a host call and spends nothing: it answers what this run
//! may *name* — its file stores, its triggers, its module functions — so that
//! `fs("typo")` fails at once naming what exists rather than deferring the
//! question to the first operation. In JavaScript those lists are closed over
//! by a per-run factory, because many runs share an isolate; here the run is the
//! thread, so the same lists are a thread-local read.
//!
//! These are `sc-expr`'s five host traits and nothing else — the same plans a
//! JavaScript body's ops carry, so the two languages cannot disagree about
//! authority, budgets or events without somebody changing the trait they share.
//! The fluent surface an author actually writes (`db.invoices.where(…).rows()`)
//! is Python — `src/py/saltcorn.py` — and lowers to these plans; what is here is
//! everything underneath it.
//!
//! # Three things happen on every call
//!
//! **The GIL is released.** [`Python::detach`] wraps the blocking wait, so a run
//! parked on a query holds a thread and not the interpreter, and every other
//! resident run executes while it waits. This is the whole of the concurrency
//! claim (specification §1) and it is one line; getting it wrong would not fail,
//! it would merely make the runtime serial.
//!
//! **The wait is bounded by the run's own deadline.** Not only the *next* call
//! is refused past it (§4's first instrument): the call already in flight is a
//! `recv_timeout` against what is left of the wall clock, because the other
//! instrument — `SetAsyncExc` — provably cannot reach a thread blocked in a host
//! call (phase 0.3), and a body parked in a five-minute request would otherwise
//! be unstoppable.
//!
//! **The budget is spent.** One counter per surface, with the same numbers and
//! the same refusal sentences a JavaScript body gets, because they are bounds on
//! what the *host* is asked to do rather than on what a language does.
//!
//! # The run's identity is the thread
//!
//! A JavaScript body carries a token because many runs are resident on one
//! isolate. Here one thread is one run, so the run's state is a thread-local and
//! there is no name in the interpreter for anybody else's — a body cannot reach
//! another run's authority because it cannot spell it.
