//! What a server built **without** `python-host` does, which is answer plainly.
//!
//! This is the build every other crate in the workspace links, and the one the
//! release tarball ships, so the behaviour under test here is the common case
//! rather than a degraded one: `run_python_code` is still registered, a trigger
//! configured with a Python body is still meaningful, and firing it says why it
//! cannot run instead of failing as a missing action.
