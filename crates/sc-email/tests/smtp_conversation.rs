//! One test against a **real SMTP conversation**.
//!
//! Everything else in this crate can be asserted against a trait, and a
//! trait-only test proves nothing about the question that actually matters here:
//! whether `lettre` was wired up correctly — whether the port is the one the
//! settings named, whether credentials are attached when a username is
//! configured, whether the message that arrives is the one that was built. So
//! these run against [`TestSmtp`], which binds a listener on `127.0.0.1` and
//! speaks enough SMTP to accept a message, and assert on what the server
//! *received*.
//!
//! `none` security throughout, because the point is the SMTP conversation and
//! not the TLS handshake: `starttls` and `tls` are two of lettre's builders in
//! `SmtpMailer::new`, and a self-signed certificate here would exercise rustls
//! rather than this crate.
