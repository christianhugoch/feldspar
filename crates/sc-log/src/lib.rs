//! How much this process says, and whether it prints the SQL it issues
//! (layer 0).
//!
//! Two switches, both of them **process-wide atomics** rather than values
//! carried down through every call: the verbosity, and whether every statement
//! sent to the database is echoed. They are set from the stored Development
//! settings (`sc_config::development`) at boot and again whenever an admin
//! saves them, so turning SQL logging on is a checkbox rather than a restart.
//!
//! **Why globals.** Logging is the one concern that cuts across the whole
//! dependency graph: the thing that wants to print a statement is the Postgres
//! driver (layer 2), the thing that knows what the admin ticked is the config
//! store (layer 5), and the layers in between have no business carrying a
//! logging handle from one to the other. An `AtomicBool` read on the statement
//! path costs a relaxed load, which is less than the `format!` it guards.
//!
//! **Where it comes out.** SQL goes to **stdout**, because it is the *output* an
//! admin turned the switch on to read — pipe it to a file, grep it. Level
//! messages go to **stderr**, so a redirected stdout is the SQL and nothing
//! else.
//!
//! **A line is the message and nothing else** — no program name, no level tag.
//! Whatever reads these logs (a terminal, `journald`, a container runtime)
//! already knows which process wrote them and which stream it used, and a
//! prefix on every line is width spent saying so twice. The consequence, taken
//! knowingly: an `info` line and a `warning` line look alike, so a message that
//! wants to be recognisable as a warning says so in its own words. It also
//! leaves the SQL echo as *valid SQL* — the binds ride in a `--` comment — so a
//! redirected stdout is a script, not a log that has to be unwrapped first.
//!
//! ```
