//! [`SqliteTransaction`] — a transaction on one pooled SQLite connection.
//!
//! A transaction owns its connection for as long as it lives, because `BEGIN` is
//! a property of a connection rather than of a statement: sharing one would pull
//! every query running beside it into the transaction. `commit` and `rollback`
//! consume the boxed handle, so a transaction is finalised exactly once, and a
//! handle dropped without either rolls back — so the connection goes back to the
//! pool clean rather than mid-transaction.
//!
//! `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`, not a plain `BEGIN`. SQLite's default deferred transaction
//! takes its write lock at the first write, which means two transactions that
//! both read and then write can reach a point where neither can proceed and one
//! is thrown out with `SQLITE_BUSY` *after* doing its work — the classic SQLite
//! upgrade deadlock, and it cannot be waited out. Taking the write lock up front
//! turns that into an ordinary wait at the start, covered by the busy timeout.
