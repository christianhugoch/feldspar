//! Turning a frame into numbers, **once**, and carrying the result on the
//! instance (TODO §6, task 3.1).
//!
//! A model provider wants numbers. A dataset column is a string, a boolean, a
//! date or a float. The translation — one-hot for a categorical feature, a label
//! mapping for a classification target, an epoch-seconds cast for a date,
//! standardisation where a provider asks for it — happens here, and the result
//! is **stored on the instance**.
//!
//! This is the single most load-bearing decision in the milestone, because the
//! failure it prevents is silent. If prediction re-derived the one-hot column
//! order from whatever categories happen to be in the rows being predicted, a
//! model fitted when `region` had four values and applied to a batch containing
//! three would put every coefficient against the wrong column and return
//! confident nonsense. Fitting the encoding once and carrying it means a
//! prediction is encoded **the way the fit was**, or it fails.
//!
//! And it fails loudly:
//!
//! - **A category at predict time that was not present at fit time is an
//!   error** naming the column and the value — not a row of zeros, which is the
//!   industry's usual answer and is a prediction from a model that was never
//!   shown this input.
//! - **A null in a feature** is a dropped row at fit time
//!   ([`apply_encoding_dropping`], counted and reported on the instance) and an
//!   error at predict time ([`apply_encoding`]). At fit time dropping is a
//!   defensible sample restriction that we report; at predict time it would mean
//!   answering a question about a row we cannot represent.
//!
//! ## One-hot is reference-coded, and the whole list is still stored
//!
//! A categorical column with *k* values becomes *k − 1* columns: the first
//! category (in sorted order) is the **baseline** and is the row of zeros. The
//! alternative — a column per category — makes the design matrix rank-deficient
//! the moment an intercept is fitted beside it, and `(XᵀX)⁻¹` is exactly what
//! the standard errors, *t* and *p* of §13 are computed from. What is *stored*
//! is the full category list, including the baseline, because that is what makes
//! "was this value seen at fit time" answerable — a value missing from the list
//! is refused, and the baseline is not a hole in the list to fall into.
//!
//! ## What the provider actually receives
//!
//! [`Encoded`] carries both shapes, because both are wanted: a [`Matrix`] —
//! row-major `Vec<f64>` plus its column names, which is what a provider's
//! arithmetic works in — and a [`Frame`], which is what
//! [`ModelProvider::fit`](crate::ModelProvider::fit) takes and what crosses a
//! module seam. They are the same numbers.
