//! The built-in MQTT stream provider (TODO §11, tasks 4.2–4.4).
//!
//! GOALS asks for one built-in stream provider and names it: MQTT. It is the
//! protocol the sensor on the wall already speaks — a broker, a topic filter, a
//! payload of whatever the publisher felt like sending — and it is the reason
//! [`ElementType`] takes the configuration rather than being a property of the
//! provider: the same broker and the same topic are a stream of objects with
//! four declared keys, a stream of text or a stream of bytes depending on one
//! setting the admin picks.
//!
//! ## What is this provider's, and what is the supervisor's
//!
//! **Connecting is this provider's. Reconnecting is not.** [`subscribe`] returns
//! only once the broker has acknowledged the subscription, so a wrong host, a
//! refused password or a filter the broker rejects is an `Err` the admin can
//! read in the stream's status — and once the flow is running, *anything* that
//! ends it (a dropped socket, a `Disconnect` from the broker, a TLS error) ends
//! the subscription's task. The supervisor then sees a subscription that has
//! ended and restarts it with capped exponential backoff (§6).
//!
//! That is a deliberate choice against rumqttc's own reconnection, which its
//! event loop will do on the next `poll` if you let it. Two reasons. Retrying
//! properly — backoff, a cap, an attempt count, a status an admin can see — is
//! written once in the supervisor for every provider, and a provider that
//! reconnected quietly underneath it would make "this stream is running" a
//! claim nobody had checked. And with `clean_session` the subscription itself
//! does not survive a reconnect: a client that comes back without re-sending
//! its `SUBSCRIBE` is connected, healthy and receiving nothing, which is the
//! worst of the available outcomes.
//!
//! ## A payload that does not match the declaration is counted, not delivered
//!
//! One misbehaving publisher on a wildcard filter must not be able to fill the
//! log or the trigger queue (§11), and on a topic like `house/#` it is not even
//! misbehaviour — a filter that matches four sensors and one heartbeat string
//! is an ordinary thing to write. So a payload that will not decode against the
//! element type is reported to [`StreamSink::malformed`] (which counts it, and
//! the count is on the Streams list) and **warned at most once a minute per
//! stream**, with the number suppressed since the last warning, so the log says
//! "and 40 more" rather than saying it 40 times. See [`MalformedThrottle`].
//!
//! ## One TLS stack, and no panic on the way to it
//!
//! `mqtts://` is the same **aws-lc-rs** rustls the HTTPS listener and `reqwest`
//! use (§16), installed as the process-wide provider here as well as in
//! `sc-server` because a stream can be the first thing in a process to want
//! TLS. The root store is built here rather than taken from rumqttc's
//! `TlsConfiguration::default()`, which panics when the platform certificates
//! cannot be read — and a panic inside the supervisor's task would take every
//! other stream's supervision with it, to report a configuration error.
//!
