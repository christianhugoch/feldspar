//! The [`Stream`]: a provider, its configuration, who may observe it, and
//! whether it is running (TODO §5, task 2.1).
//!
//! Pure data, like a `Trigger`, an `Agent` or a `Model` — the row it is stored
//! as lives in [`store`](crate::store), the validation it must pass in
//! `validate` (task 2.2), and the subscription that makes it *flow* in the
//! supervisor (Phase 3). A stream knows nothing about how it is observed, which
//! is what lets the same record be started at boot, reloaded on a `SIGHUP`,
//! rendered in a form and exposed to an application without reshaping anything.
//!
//! **There is no `element_type` field**, and that is the one thing worth
//! reading this module for. The element type is a pure function of `provider` +
//! `configuration` ([`StreamProvider::element_type`](crate::StreamProvider::element_type)),
//! so storing a copy would be a second answer that drifts the day a provider's
//! declaration changes — and the drift would be invisible, because the stored
//! copy is what the Observe screen and the generated client would be reading
//! while the live decoder used the other one. It is computed on read and cached
//! on the running stream instead.
