//! Validating a [`Stream`] before it is stored (TODO task 2.2).
//!
//! Every way a stream can be wrong is checked in one place, and checked **on
//! save**, because that is when the admin is standing in front of the form: a
//! provider nothing implements, a broker setting the provider does not declare,
//! a `payload = json` with no keys, a name that cannot be a URL path segment.
//!
//! The cost of not checking is higher here than for a model and higher than for
//! a trigger, and it is worth saying why. A model that fails validation does not
//! fit; a trigger that fails does not fire. A stream that is wrong **connects
//! anyway** — the supervisor subscribes to whatever the row says, and a
//! mis-declared element type means every payload from a healthy broker is
//! counted as malformed and thrown away, silently, at the rate the sensor
//! publishes. So the last moment anybody can act on it cheaply is the form.
//!
//! ## Everything but uniqueness is a pure function
//!
//! [`check_stream`] takes a registry and a value and nothing else, so it is
//! asserted without a database — `sc-viewpattern`'s split, for its reason. Only
//! one check needs to ask the database a question ("does another stream already
//! answer to this name?"), and [`validate_stream`] is that one plus this one.
//! What that buys is that the interesting half — every refusal an admin will
//! actually meet — is a unit test rather than a live-database test.
//!
//! ## Why the name is an identifier and not just "not empty"
//!
//! A stream's name is not only a label. It appears, unescaped, in four places:
//!
//! - the **path segment** of the observe socket, `{mount}/streams/{name}/observe`
//!   and the admin's own (§9, §10);
//! - a trigger's **`channel`**, which is matched as a string (§8);
//! - the generated client's **`observeStream_{name}()`**, which has to be a
//!   legal TypeScript identifier (§10, task 8.3);
//! - MQTT's default **`client_id`**, `feldspar-{name}` (§11).
//!
//! A view's name is allowed spaces because v1 named views `List Books` and a
//! restored backup has to be accepted. A stream has no v1 and no backup — it is
//! new in this milestone — so the strict rule costs an admin one underscore and
//! saves every consumer downstream from deciding whether to percent-encode,
//! quote or mangle. `boiler_temp`, not `boiler temp` and not `boiler/temp`.
