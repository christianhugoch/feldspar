//! [`Subscription`] and [`Stop`]: a running flow, and the handle that ends it
//! (TODO §3, task 1.4).
//!
//! This is the one deliberate difference between
//! [`StreamProvider`](crate::StreamProvider) and every
//! other extension point in this tree. An `Action` runs and returns; a
//! `ModelProvider` fits and returns; a **subscription does not return** — it is
//! process-local, long-lived, and the only question anybody above it asks is
//! "is it still going, and how do I stop it?".
//!
//! [`StreamProvider::subscribe`](crate::StreamProvider::subscribe) therefore
//! **returns rather than blocks**, handing back an owned handle whose `Drop`
//! stops the flow. That is what makes "stop this stream" a `drop`, which is
//! what makes the supervisor's reload path a diff over a map rather than a
//! protocol with a provider (§6).
//!
//! ## Stopping is prompt, not polite
//!
//! Dropping the handle does two things: it closes the [`Stop`] the provider's
//! task is selecting on, and it aborts the task. The abort is there because the
//! callers are a reload, a disable and a shutdown, and none of them can wait on
//! a provider that is blocked reading a socket that will never answer. A
//! provider with a goodbye to say says it from the `Drop` of what it owns — the
//! client, the connection — which runs either way.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # use sc_stream::Subscription;
//! let subscription = Subscription::spawn(|mut stop| async move {
//!     loop {
//!         tokio::select! {
//!             _ = stop.stopped() => break,
//!             _ = tokio::time::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_secs(1)) => { /* poll */ }
//!         }
//!     }
//! });
//! drop(subscription); // the loop ends
//! ```
