//! The `_fd_streams` table: its schema, bootstrap, and the [`Stream`] ⇄ row
//! mapping (TODO §5; design §9).
//!
//! §9's rule applies here with nothing to argue about. A stream, like a trigger
//! or a model, has **nothing to introspect it from**: no column in
//! `information_schema` says "subscribe to `house/boiler/#` on this broker and
//! read each payload as an object with a `temperature` float in it". So its row
//! *is* its definition — this is not an overlay, and without the row there is
//! no stream at all.
//!
//! **Reading is strict**, as `load_model` and `load_trigger` are: a
//! column that is missing or of the wrong shape is an [`Error::invalid`] naming
//! the stream and the column, never a silently defaulted field. The failure
//! that prevents is specific to this entity and worse than a form that will not
//! open: a stream read with half a configuration would *connect anyway*, to the
//! wrong broker or the wrong topic, and deliver elements that look exactly like
//! the right ones.
//!
//! The judgements §5 asks for, made out loud:
//!
//! - **`element_type` is not a column.** It is a pure function of `provider` +
//!   `configuration` ([`StreamProvider::element_type`](crate::StreamProvider::element_type)),
//!   and a stored copy would be a second answer that drifts the day a
//!   provider's declaration changes. Computed on read, cached on the running
//!   stream. See [`stream`](crate::stream)'s module docs.
//! - **`min_role` is nullable and NULL is the restrictive end** — admin-only,
//!   the way a trigger's is. A flow nobody has thought about the access of is
//!   not public.
//! - **`enabled` is an attribute, not a column**, because §9 says sparse: a
//!   stream that has never been switched off carries no key saying so, and the
//!   supervisor reads [`Stream::is_enabled`].
//!
//! What is *not* here: validation (see [`validate`](crate::validate), which
//! [`save_stream`] calls) and the secret round trip (see
//! [`secrets`](crate::secrets), whose inward half [`save_stream`] calls too).
//!
//! [`Error::invalid`]: sc_error::Error::invalid
