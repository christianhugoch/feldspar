//! [`StreamSupervisor`]: the thing that keeps subscriptions running (TODO §6,
//! tasks 3.2–3.5).
//!
//! `sc-server`'s `ModelServices` in role and `Scheduler` in shape — one
//! supervising task, started at boot, holding one [`RunningStream`] per enabled
//! row. It is the only thing in this tree that owns a [`Subscription`](crate::Subscription), which
//! is what makes "is this stream running?" a question with one answer.
//!
//! ## Reconnection is the supervisor's, not the provider's
//!
//! A `subscribe` that returns `Err`, and a subscription that *ends*, are the
//! same event here: the flow stopped, and it should be tried again with
//! [capped exponential backoff](backoff_delay), counting attempts. Written once
//! here rather than once per provider, because "retry properly" is the part
//! every provider gets subtly wrong — and the two ways to get it wrong are
//! opposite and both common. A provider that retries in a tight loop turns a
//! broker restart into a DoS on the broker; one that gives up after three
//! attempts turns a twenty-minute outage into a stream that is silently dead
//! until somebody notices next week. A provider's whole job here is to fail
//! honestly and quickly.
//!
//! A **successful** subscribe resets the count, so a broker that accepts a
//! connection and immediately drops it is retried at the floor delay for ever
//! rather than backing off. That is deliberate: the floor is a second, one
//! connection a second is not a load anybody notices, and the alternative —
//! remembering failures across a connection that worked — would make a stream
//! that recovered from a morning's outage slow to recover from the afternoon's.
//!
//! ## The clock is a parameter
//!
//! [`tick`](StreamSupervisor::tick) takes `now` rather than reading it, exactly
//! as `Scheduler::tick` does, and [`start`](StreamSupervisor::start) — the task
//! loop — is the only place `Utc::now()` is read for a retry decision. That is
//! what lets a test drive an hour of backoff in a millisecond, so task 3.3's
//! "the third subscribe succeeds" is an assertion rather than a sleep.
//!
//! ## A reload is a diff, not a restart
//!
//! [`reload`](StreamSupervisor::reload) compares the stored rows against the
//! running set **by id**:
//!
//! | The row | What happens |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | new, or newly enabled | started |
//! | deleted | stopped and forgotten |
//! | disabled | stopped, kept, status `stopped` |
//! | `provider` or `configuration` changed | stopped and started |
//! | anything else changed (name, description, `min_role`) | **connection kept**, row swapped |
//! | unchanged | nothing at all |
//!
//! That last row is the load-bearing one. An admin fixing a typo in a
//! description must not drop a broker session — and a `SIGHUP`, which reloads
//! everything, must not drop all of them.
//!
//! ## One process, one subscription
//!
//! Two servers against one database both subscribe, so a stream trigger fires
//! twice. That is real, it is §6's, and it is not a bug to be discovered:
//! `sc-bus` does not exist, and until it does a flow is process-local. MQTT's
//! own shared subscriptions (`$share/`) are the escape hatch an admin has
//! today.
