//! The physical schema as the database sees it, plus the schema-change requests

//!
//! Two directions:
//!
//! - [`PhysicalTable`] and friends are the *result* of
//!   [`introspect`](crate::DatabaseDriver::introspect): the live shape of a
//!   table read from `information_schema`. Per the goals there is no table
//!   discovery step — as soon as a database is connected, every table is usable,
//!   so introspection is the source of truth and stored metadata is only an
//!   optional overlay (§5, §9).
//! - [`SchemaChange`] is the *input* to
//!   [`apply_schema`](crate::DatabaseDriver::apply_schema): a single create/drop
//!   table or add/drop column. Notably, creating a table does **not** invent an
//!   `id` column — key fields are declared explicitly like any other (§5).
//!
//! Both model composite primary keys and foreign keys to non-primary-key
//! columns, which the goals require, so keys are always `Vec<String>` and never
//! "the id column".
