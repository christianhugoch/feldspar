//! The email settings: how this installation sends mail, and to whom it says it
//! is from (design §18.2).
//!
//! One transport, configured the way an admin already knows how to configure a
//! mail client: a host, a port, a security mode, a username and password, and
//! the address messages come from. There is no mode switch of the kind [`ssl`]
//! has, because there is nothing to switch between — an installation with a
//! `smtp_host` sends mail and one without it does not, which is why
//! [`EmailSettings::load`] answers `Option` rather than a "disabled" variant.
//!
//! The keys live here, next to the type that reads them, so adding one cannot
//! leave the declaration and the reader disagreeing about its name or its type —
//! the arrangement [`crate::ssl`] is in.
//!
//! **The password is a `secret`** ([`FormField::secret`]): redacted wherever the
//! settings are serialised, and a save that submits the sentinel back keeps what
//! is stored. It is *not* encrypted at rest — it sits in the primary database
//! like the TLS private key and like an LLM provider's API key (§11.1) — and
//! saying so is better than implying a protection a database dump would
//! disprove.
