//! Saltcorn UI's view runtime exists and evaluates, and is the shape v1's is
//! (TODO "Saltcorn UI" 2.2, 2.7).
//!
//! Reads the **real** `ui/saltcorn-ui/dist/view-runtime.js` and runs
//! `bundle_shape.mjs` over it under `node`, which asserts: the six patterns are
//! registered under the names v1 gives them; every specifier of the library
//! resolves to what a v1 `require` resolves to, with every export v1 has on it
//! (`vendor/v1-exports.json`, recorded from v1 by `vendor/refresh.sh`); every
//! plugin-helper export is on exactly one side of the partition, refused ones
//! refuse by name and absent ones are `undefined`; and loading the bundle calls
//! nothing on the host.
//!
//! Why `node` rather than the module worker: this is the bundle as a build
//! artefact, checked where it is built — a bundle exists only where a Node
//! toolchain ran — and the worker that loads it is Phase 3's, with its own tests.
//!
//! Runs in every `cargo test` that has a built bundle. A checkout built with
//! `SC_BUILD_ADMIN=0` has none, and the test says so and passes.
