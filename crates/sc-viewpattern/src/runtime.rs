//! [`ViewRuntime`]: the seam a view is rendered through (TODO "Saltcorn UI" §3,
//! Phase 3).
//!
//! A view pattern is v1's own JavaScript, and it runs on the module worker this
//! process already has (`sc-module`), so it is declared here and implemented one
//! layer up — the arrangement `sc-catalog` has with `TableProviderHost` and
//! `sc-app` with `FrameworkHost`. Nothing at this layer knows a worker exists.
//!
//! What crosses the seam is **the name of a view and data**. The view itself —
//! its pattern, its configuration, the views it embeds — is read out of the
//! [`ViewSnapshot`] the call carries, because an embedded view recurses inside
//! the worker and has to find its neighbours the way the outer one was found.
//!
//! Every call carries the viewer's surfaces ([`CodeHosts`]) and the schema
//! snapshot, so every read a pattern makes is a read under the viewer's
//! authority (§11). The seam does not decide that authority; its caller does.
