//! Saltcorn UI: v1-style views and pages, owned by an application (layer 8;
//! TODO "Saltcorn UI" §1, §4).
//!
//! A **view** is a view pattern (v1 calls it a view template) configured over one
//! table; a **page** is a layout that places views. In Saltcorn 1 both are global
//! to a tenant. Here the unit of multi-tenancy is the [`Application`](sc_app::Application),
//! so both belong to one: `_fd_views.application` and `_fd_pages.application` are
//! columns, a name is unique **per application**, and a view may only name a table
//! in its application's subset. Everything else about a view is v1's — the
//! pattern name, the `min_role`, the slug, and a `configuration` that is
//! **v1-shaped and deliberately untouched**, because it is what v1's own
//! `list.ts` reads.
//!
//! What is here:
//!
//! - [`View`] / [`Page`], their ids, and the two tables ([`bootstrap`]).
//! - The row path, scoped by [`AppId`](sc_app::AppId): [`save_view`],
//!   [`load_view`], [`list_views`], [`delete_view`] and the page four, with the
//!   save-time validation of §1 and §11 — the pattern is registered, the table is
//!   in the application's subset, `min_role` is a role that exists, and the name
//!   is unique in the application and usable as a URL path segment.
//! - The pattern registry ([`registered_patterns`]): v1's six built-in patterns,
//!   and whatever an installed module declares (Phase 11) — and the headers and
//!   `public/` directory such a module brings with its patterns
//!   ([`installed_plugin_assets`]).
//! - [`ViewSet`] — every view and page of one application, loaded once — and
//!   [`ViewSets`], the cache that reloads a set on a write and stamps it with the
//!   **generation** the worker's view snapshot is keyed on (§4).
//! - Where the view runtime is ([`require_view_runtime`]): the `ui/saltcorn-ui`
//!   bundle, and the sentence an application that needs it fails to mount with
//!   when this server was built without it.
//! - [`ViewSnapshot`] — an application's views, pages and settings serialised at
//!   one generation, which is what v1's synchronous `View.findOne` is answered
//!   from on the worker (§4).
//! - [`ViewRuntime`] — the seam a view is rendered, posted to and configured
//!   through, declared here and implemented by `sc-module` over its worker
//!   (§3), and the one installed at boot ([`view_runtime`]).
//! - [`SaltcornUiFramework`] — the framework that serves an application's views
//!   and pages on its subdomain, constructed by [`SaltcornUiFactory`] from
//!   `sc-app`'s factory registry ([`install_saltcorn_ui`]).
