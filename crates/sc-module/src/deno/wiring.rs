//! The four wirings a Deno worker needs to run a v1 CommonJS plugin, and the
//! worker built from them.
//!
//! Phase 0 measured these and they are as small as they look: a module loader
//! that is `FsModuleLoader` plus one branch, a `NodeRequireLoader` with three
//! methods, a `ByonmNpmResolver` over the modules root's own `node_modules`, and
//! one line of `sys_traits`. Nothing needed a workaround and nothing here is a
//! shim over node — it *is* node, as `deno_runtime` implements it.
//!
//! ## The permission set (phase 3, specification §2)
//!
//! A worker is built with a [`PermissionsContainer`] made from one
//! [`ModulePermissions`] — the row's allow-lists — and **closed is the default**,
//! so a module reaches no host, no path and no variable until an admin grants
//! it one. This is the capability the `node` sidecar had no way to offer: its
//! modules ran with the server's own privileges because `node` has no permission
//! model to ask for.
//!
//! Two details of the shape, both deliberate:
//!
//! - **`require` may read the modules root, the container may not.** A module
//!   that cannot read the package it is made of cannot exist, so the read
//!   `require` performs is allowed by [`ModuleRequireLoader`] itself, against
//!   the root and nothing else. `node:fs` reading the same directory goes
//!   through the container and is denied. The code a module is made of is not a
//!   capability; the filesystem it is sitting on is.
//! - **A denied environment variable is `undefined`, not a throw.** Deno's
//!   `ignore` state does it, and the reason is node compatibility: half of npm
//!   reads `process.env.NODE_ENV` speculatively at load, and a throw there would
//!   be a rule that most modules may not be installed. Net, read and write
//!   denials *are* errors, because there is something for an admin to do about
//!   each of them.
//!
//! What is never granted, because there is no allow-list for it: subprocesses,
//! FFI, and `import` off the disk.
//!
//! ## And no startup snapshot, which is not the bargain phase 0 struck
//!
//! Phase 0 measured a build-time snapshot at 150 ms and ~5 MB per worker start
//! and its gate withdrew "the first version may go without one". Phase 2 has to
//! put it back, because of something the spike's process could not show:
//!
//! **V8 shares one read-only heap across every isolate in a process, and the
//! first isolate built decides it.** A `deno_runtime` worker built from a custom
//! startup snapshot *after* a bare `deno_core` isolate exists aborts the process
//! in V8's own deserializer — `vector[] index out of bounds`, not an error a
//! `Result` can carry. `sc_expr`'s code isolates are bare `deno_core` and carry
//! no snapshot, so in the server the two pools cannot both have their way.
//!
//! The reverse order happens to work (a custom snapshot's read-only heap is the
//! embedded one's, so a later bare isolate is content), and **that is not a
//! fix**: both pools are lazy by design — a deployment with no modules never
//! builds a module isolate, and a deployment with no code bodies never builds a
//! code one — so "the module pool must go first" is an invariant nothing could
//! keep. What is given up is 150 ms on the first module call after a start, once
//! per worker, on a path that already waits on npm and somebody else's network.
//!
//! `deno_runtime`'s `transpile` feature is what makes going without one possible
//! at all: the runtime's extension sources are TypeScript, and with no snapshot
//! to hold the transpiled form there has to be a transpiler in the worker.
