//! One module worker: its thread, its isolate, the four bounds it is under, and
//! what happens when it dies.
//!
//! The thread spends its life inside one `block_on`. The loop it runs there
//! serves three things at once — control messages from the pool, answers coming
//! back out of the isolate, and the worker's own event loop — and the fourth
//! branch, a 50 ms tick, is not a timer but an **instrument**: it is how the
//! thread proves to its watchdog that it is still coming round, and how it
//! notices a `process.exit()` that happened while the event loop was parked on
//! an idle socket with no JavaScript to throw out of.
//!
//! ## The seam, which is four V8 functions and no protocol
//!
//! A call is `globalThis.__scModuleHost(id, request)` — one V8 function call
//! with the request converted straight into a V8 object — and the answer comes
//! back through native functions this file installs on the isolate's global
//! before the host script is evaluated:
//!
//! | | |
//! |---|---|
//! | `__scDone(id, jsonText)` | the call answered; the text is `JSON.stringify`'s |
//! | `__scFail(id, message, stack)` | the call threw |
//! | `__scLog(level, module, message)` | one `console.*` line, into [`sc_log`] |
//! | `__scAsk(callId, askId, requestJson)` | the module is asking this server something |
//!
//! `__scAsk` is the only one that runs the other way, and it is what makes the
//! v1 `Table` work inside a module (TODO "the v1 `Table` API" §3). It answers
//! nothing: the ask is routed to **the caller of the call it belongs to**,
//! because that is where a `CodeHosts` is borrowed on somebody's stack, and the
//! answer comes back as a [`Control::Answer`] on the channel this worker
//! already selects on — which the worker hands to the isolate by calling
//! `globalThis.__scAnswer(askId, ok, text)`, the one function the *host script*
//! installs rather than this file.
//!
//! The bounds are unchanged and it is worth saying why: an ask is served on the
//! server's own tokio task, not this thread, so a module parked on a query is
//! not holding the JS slice — the watchdog's clock is about JavaScript that does
//! not yield, and awaiting a promise yields.
//!
//! **Native functions rather than ops**, which is not a preference: an op is
//! reached from JavaScript through `Deno.core.ops`, and `deno_runtime`'s worker
//! bootstrap ends by calling `removeImportedOps()`, which deletes every entry
//! there that is not on its own allow-list. A module host's ops would be gone
//! before its main module ran. A function set on `globalThis` is not, and it
//! costs less: `v8::Function::new` and a `v8::Global`.
//!
//! The `id` is still the worker's, because the reason for it never was the
//! transport: many calls are in flight at once and a slow module's action must
//! not hold anybody else's. What crosses back is `JSON.stringify`'s text and not
//! the value, because the value is a *module's* object — a function property, a
//! stream, a cycle — and `JSON.stringify` is the rule v1 itself applies to one.
