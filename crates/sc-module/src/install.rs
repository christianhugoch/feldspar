//! Installing and uninstalling a module's package, with `npm`.
//!
//! **npm is the installer** because a package's dependency tree is npm's
//! problem: `@saltcorn/mqtt` is a thin wrapper over `async-mqtt`, which has a
//! tree of its own, and resolving that tree is a package manager's whole job.
//! The alternative — fetching a tarball and unpacking it — installs the wrapper
//! and nothing it needs.
//!
//! The modules root is one npm project this crate owns ([`crate::paths`]), so an
//! install is `npm install <spec>` in it and the package lands at
//! `node_modules/<name>`. A **local directory** installs the same way, with
//! `--install-links`, which **copies** it in rather than symlinking it. That is
//! deliberate and it is the difference between working and not: npm does not
//! install a symlinked package's dependencies (they are the checkout's own
//! business), and — worse — it ignores the project's `overrides` for them, so a
//! linked v1 plugin both fails to find `async-mqtt` *and* downloads the whole of
//! v1's server. A copy is an ordinary node in the tree, and both problems go
//! away. The price is that editing the checkout changes nothing until it is
//! installed again, which is the "Install" button pressed a second time.
//!
//! **The `@saltcorn/*` dependencies are never downloaded.** A v1 plugin depends
//! on `@saltcorn/data` — v1's server, the program this one replaces, and some
//! 270 MB with its tree — which the host's `require` hook answers itself before
//! a line of it could be read. So the project depends on a local stub package of
//! the same name and declares an npm **override** redirecting the module's
//! dependency to it (see [`V1_API_PACKAGES`] and
//! [`Installer::write_overrides`]).
//!
//! **What the package is called is read from the package**, never from what the
//! admin typed: a specifier may carry a version (`@saltcorn/mqtt@0.2.0`), may be
//! a path, and may be a `github:` shorthand. The name is recovered by diffing
//! the project's `dependencies` across the install, which is the one answer that
//! is right for all three.
//!
//! **npm 9.3.0 is the floor**, and it is checked before an install rather than
//! discovered during one: the `file:` dependency and the override above are a
//! pair that npm 9.2.0 — which is what Debian 12, Debian 13 and Ubuntu 24.04
//! package — cannot resolve, and its own diagnosis of that is a semver error about a
//! comparator. See [`check_npm_version`].
//!
//! A failure carries **npm's own output** (§16): "npm exited 1" is not a
//! diagnosis, while the registry 404, the unreachable proxy or the ENOSPC
//! underneath it tells the admin what to do.
