//! **Both V8 pools in one process**, and a module runtime that does not need the
//! machine it was built on.
//!
//! Two properties, and each one is a production failure that got here.
//!
//! 1. **Order.** A module worker deserialises a V8 startup snapshot; `sc_expr`'s
//!    formula and code isolates are bare `deno_core` ones. V8 shares one
//!    read-only heap per process, and a snapshot isolate built against a heap
//!    somebody else established aborts the process — `SIGABRT` inside V8, no
//!    error to catch. `prime_v8` establishes it from the snapshot and holds it,
//!    and that is what this asserts: run a code body first, then load a module.
//!    Without the prime this file does not fail, it *crashes the test binary*,
//!    which is the shape of the bug it is guarding.
//!
//! 2. **Portability.** `deno_core` records extension JavaScript by the absolute
//!    path it had on the build machine and reads it at every worker start unless
//!    a snapshot holds it. A release tarball carries a binary and no cargo
//!    registry, so a server built here and run there died in `JsRuntime::new`
//!    with `Permission denied (os error 13)` — the unit's `ProtectHome=true`
//!    masking a `/home` that had nothing in it anyway — and every module install
//!    reported "supplying nothing this version of Saltcorn loads". The second
//!    test reproduces that host: it hides the build tree behind a tmpfs in a
//!    mount namespace and starts a worker in there.
