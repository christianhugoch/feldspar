//! Shared setup for the module tests: the fixture packages, a throwaway modules
//! root, and the toolchain check.
//!
//! Most tests here need `npm`, which is what *installs* a module. None of them
//! needs `node`: a module runs on a Deno worker inside the test binary. A
//! Rust-only checkout must stay green, so a test that needs npm **skips** rather
//! than fails — the same contract the `tsc` type-check tests have.
