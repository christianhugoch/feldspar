//! What every coding tool shares: the file store it works in, and the paths it
//! will accept (§11.3, TODO Phase 5).
//!
//! `read_file`, `find_files`, `search_files`, `write_file`, `edit_file`,
//! `apply_patch` and `run_script` are seven tools over one **scope** — a configured file store,
//! optionally rooted at a sub-directory — and the scope is here rather than in
//! any one of them for the reason [`crate::table`] gives: each of them is a
//! promise to the model, and a path that means one thing to `read_file` and
//! another to `edit_file` is a model that cannot use either. That they now
//! share a *single configuration* as well ([`crate::Coding`]) is the same
//! argument taken one step further.
//!
//! ## The root, and what it is for
//!
//! A store already confines every path to itself: the byte-level methods reject
//! an absolute path and any `..` that would escape the store root. The
//! configured [`CFG_ROOT`] is the *second* confinement, and the one an admin
//! sets: "this agent may work in `web/todo`, not in the rest of the store". So a
//! path the model sends is resolved **under** the root and refused if it tries to
//! leave, exactly as it is refused for trying to leave the store — and every path
//! the model is *shown* is relative to that root, because a model told about a
//! prefix it may not change will eventually send it back and be refused for it.
//!
//! ## Access is §9's rule, unchanged
//!
//! Every path goes through [`check_access`](sc_files::check_access) with the
//! run's caller, so the path-cumulative rule the file manager applies applies
//! here: an agent chatting with a user is not a way to read a directory that
//! user could not open. The store's own floor is part of it, which is why
//! [`FileScope::connect`] returns the two together and nothing in this crate
//! reads a store without it.
