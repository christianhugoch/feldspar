//! Selecting the rows a write trait is about to change (§11.3).
//!
//! `update_rows` and `delete_rows` both start the same way: find the rows the
//! filter selects, refuse the call outright if there are too many, and then
//! write them one at a time by primary key. That shape is here once because each
//! of its three decisions is a promise, and two of them are safety properties
//! that must not be able to differ between the two traits.
//!
//! **The rows are selected through [`sc_api::read_rows_as`]** — the caller's own
//! read. So a tool can only change rows the same caller could have been shown,
//! and an agent chatting with a user whose ownership formula hides half the
//! table cannot update the half it cannot see. That is a stronger rule than the
//! write path alone would give (each row is *also* checked for write access as
//! it is written), and it is the right way round: an agent that could change
//! rows it cannot read would be a way to edit data by guessing at it.
//!
//! **Too many rows is a refusal, not a truncation.** One row more than the
//! ceiling and nothing is written at all, with a message saying how many matched
//! and that the filter should be narrowed. A partially applied bulk change is
//! the one outcome from which neither the model nor the person watching can tell
//! what happened.
//!
//! **One row at a time, by primary key.** Not one bulk statement: that is what
//! gives each changed row its own event with its own payload (§10.2's decision
//! 2, which the actions of the same names already take), and what lets §7.3's
//! per-row check apply at all. The consequence — inherited from those actions,
//! and stated here rather than hidden — is that a row that fails *while* the
//! loop is running stops it with the rows before it already written. There is no
//! transaction around the set, because the events are dispatched after commit by
//! design; the ceiling above is what keeps the set small enough for the error to
//! name what happened.
