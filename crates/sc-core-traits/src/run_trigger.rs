//! `run_trigger` — one configured trigger as one tool (§11.3).
//!
//! This is the trait that connects an agent to the whole of §10: anything a
//! trigger can do — insert rows, call a web service, run JavaScript, and a
//! workflow once §10.3 lands, because a workflow is a trigger — becomes
//! something an agent can be given, one trigger at a time and by name.
//!
//! Three properties, each of which is the reason the trait is not simply "run
//! any action":
//!
//! - **It runs the dispatcher's trigger, not a copy of it.** The call goes
//!   through the *same* [`TriggerDispatcher`](sc_action::TriggerDispatcher) every
//!   other event fires on, so the `only_if` runs, the cascade depth is counted,
//!   a disabled trigger stays disabled and a trigger that failed validation says
//!   why. An agent is one more thing that can ask; it is not a second way to
//!   fire.
//! - **The trigger's own `min_role` still gates it.** Exposing an agent to a
//!   role does not thereby expose everything the agent can reach: a user at role
//!   80 chatting with an agent that has `run_trigger` over an admin-only trigger
//!   is refused, in the tool result, naming the trigger. A trigger-started run
//!   carries the trigger's authority and clears any floor, which is decision 5
//!   read the other way round.
//! - **The payload is the event's payload.** Whatever the model sends is what
//!   the trigger's action sees as the event — which is what `POST
//!   {mount}/actions/{name}` sends and what the admin's Run button sends, so a
//!   trigger behaves the same however it was asked.
