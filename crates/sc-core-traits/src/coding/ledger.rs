//! The change ledger and the run's diff (TODO §6).
//!
//! **The model edits, and the harness produces the diff** (R§3.1). The first
//! time a run touches a path, the ledger records what was there before: the
//! text, or that nothing was. Deletes and moves are touches like any other, and
//! a move is also recorded as a move. The run's diff is then the ledger's
//! pre-images against what the store holds now, computed here with `similar`,
//! so every store backend gets one, S3 included, and no git is needed.
//!
//! Later phases read the ledger too: the test ratchet (a deleted test file, a
//! test block removed) and the per-feature commit.
//!
//! **Large files.** A pre-image over [`MAX_PRE_IMAGE_BYTES`], or one that is not
//! text, is kept as a hash and a size only. The run's state is saved with the
//! run after every step, and a megabyte of bundle copied into it each time costs
//! more than a line-level diff of that file is worth. Such a file still shows up
//! as changed, without its lines.
