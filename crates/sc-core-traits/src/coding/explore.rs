//! `explore` — ask a cheap session of this agent where something is (TODO 9.8).
//!
//! A question about the code that would take several searches and reads is
//! handed to a fresh session of the same agent in `explore` mode, answered by
//! the cheap role, with read-only tools. Its reads and searches happen in its
//! own context, and only the brief comes back: the asking run pays for a few
//! hundred words instead of every file the answer took.
