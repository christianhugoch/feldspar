//! What `coding` adds to the system prompt (TODO 8.1, R§4).
//!
//! R§4's layered skeleton: a `<workflow>`, the `<rules>`, and an `<edit_format>`
//! holding only the rules of the edit tool the run is offered. Role and platform
//! are the agent's own prompt, which comes first; the project (`AGENTS.md`) is
//! the session header's ([`super::header`]).
//!
//! **A function of the mode, the grants and the edit format, and nothing
//! else.** It is part of the cached prefix, so it names only tools the run is
//! offered — a workflow step that says "run check" to an agent without `check`
//! would send a cheap model looking for a tool that is not there — and it says
//! the same thing on every step.
//!
//! Short on purpose. R§4 budgets 1.5k tokens for the prompt and the tools
//! together, and the tool descriptions already say how each tool is called, so
//! this says only *when* and *in what order*.
