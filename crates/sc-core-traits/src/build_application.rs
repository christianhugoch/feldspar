//! `build_application` — build the app whose source the agent is editing (§11.3).
//!
//! The trait that closes the loop. An agent that can read, search and edit a
//! project can produce a change that does not compile, and a model that is not
//! told cannot fix it. So the build's **diagnostics are the tool result**: a
//! failed build is not an exception here, it is the most useful answer this tool
//! ever returns.
//!
//! Three decisions:
//!
//! - **A failed build comes back as a result, not an error.** `built: false` with
//!   the tools' own output and the file/line/message triples parsed out of it.
//!   The loop would have turned an `Err` into a tool result anyway (§11.2), but
//!   flattened to a sentence; the model can act on a list of diagnostics, and the
//!   admin watching the transcript can read one.
//! - **It builds the *stored* application**, resolved by subdomain from
//!   `_fd_applications` and built through the same `sc_app::build_application`
//!   the admin's Build button runs — the client is regenerated, a React app's
//!   runtime is regenerated, the same bundler runs over the same tree. A second
//!   build path would be a second set of results to explain.
//! - **It does not mount what it built.** Mounting is the server's (§13.2 — "the
//!   mount registry is live"), and an agent's build is a *check*: the question is
//!   "does this compile?", not "serve this to the world". An admin publishes what
//!   the agent produced by pressing Build, which is also where they get to look
//!   at the diff first.
