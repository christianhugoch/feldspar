//! The trigger half of [`admin_copilot`](super): four tools over `_sc_triggers`.
//!
//! [`describe_triggers`](TOOL_DESCRIBE_TRIGGERS) reads the trigger set,
//! [`describe_action`](TOOL_DESCRIBE_ACTION) hands back what one action may be
//! configured with, [`save_trigger`](TOOL_SAVE_TRIGGER) writes one and
//! [`delete_trigger`](TOOL_DELETE_TRIGGER) removes one. Why the settings arrive
//! through a tool of their own rather than through a nested inference call is the
//! decision recorded in the parent module, and is the whole reason this file is
//! shaped the way it is.
//!
//! ## Everything goes through the same save path
//!
//! [`sc_action::save_trigger`] is the one authority, exactly as
//! [`sc_api::schema_edit`] is for the schema half: the same
//! [`validate_trigger`](sc_action::validate_trigger) that stands in front of the
//! admin's own form runs here, against the same
//! [`ActionRegistry`](sc_action::ActionRegistry) the dispatcher will fire with. So
//! an agent cannot save a trigger an admin could not have saved, and the message
//! it is refused with is the message the admin would have read.
//!
//! Afterwards the dispatcher is **reloaded**, so what the agent just wrote is
//! live before the tool result comes back — which is what lets the model say "it
//! is set up" truthfully, and what lets a following `run_trigger` find it.
//!
//! ## Two things the model is not asked to know
//!
//! - **Identity is the name.** A trigger's row has a UUID; nothing here shows it
//!   or accepts it. The name is what an API path, a Run button and an
//!   application's exposed subset already reference (§10.2), so it is what the
//!   model works in, and `save_trigger` resolves it to a row itself.
//! - **Omitted means unchanged.** An edit sends only what is changing, the same
//!   way `alter_table` does; `null` is how something is *cleared*, and the two
//!   are distinguished rather than collapsed. Sending the whole object back would
//!   mean a model that forgot one field silently reset it.
