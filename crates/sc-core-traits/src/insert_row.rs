//! `insert_row` — add one row to a configured table (§11.3).
//!
//! The first of the three write traits, and the reason there are three: a
//! read-only agent is the default shape, and each grant beyond it is a separate
//! entry in the trait list with a form of its own. An admin reading an agent's
//! definition can see that it may insert into `orders` and may not delete from
//! it, without reading any code.
//!
//! The write goes through [`sc_api::insert_row_as`], which is §7.3's write rule
//! (`meets min_role_write` **or** the ownership formula grants the proposed row)
//! followed by `sc_api::rows::create_row_ctx` — so the values are coerced and
//! validated against the field types, a `File` field is checked against its
//! store, and the table's own insert trigger fires with the row the model wrote.
//! An agent is a caller of the row layer, not a second one.
