//! `preview_pane` — a page beside the conversation (TODO "The preview pane").
//!
//! The one trait that contributes **no tool and no prompt**. What it declares is
//! a fact about the *chat*, not about the model: that this agent's work can be
//! looked at, and where. The admin's chat screen reads it off the agent and
//! offers a button that splits the screen — the conversation in a column on the
//! left, the configured URL in an `<iframe>` filling the rest — with the usual
//! three widths (full, tablet, phone) for looking at a layout, and a reload when
//! the agent finishes a turn, because that is when what the pane is showing has
//! just changed.
//!
//! An application's builder agent is created with it, pointed at the
//! application's own subdomain (`sc_app::preview_pane_url`), which is the case
//! that asked for it: someone building a React app wants to watch the app, not
//! read about it. It is a trait rather than a property of that one agent because
//! nothing in it is about building applications — an agent that edits a
//! documentation site, or drives a dashboard, wants the same screen.
//!
//! ## Why the URL may carry `{host}`
//!
//! An agent is stored once and read from wherever the admin happens to be open:
//! `localhost:3000` in development, the deployment's own domain in production.
//! An application's URL is its subdomain on *that* host, and the base domain is a
//! server setting the agent record does not carry. So the stored value may be a
//! template with one name in it — `{host}` — and the browser resolves it against
//! its own location, which is exactly how the applications list already derives
//! an app's link. `//todo.{host}` therefore follows the deployment instead of
//! pinning it.
//!
//! ## What is refused
//!
//! The value ends up in an `iframe src`, so the schemes that can execute in the
//! admin's own origin are refused on save: `http:`, `https:`, a
//! protocol-relative `//host/path` and an absolute path are the whole of what is
//! accepted, and `javascript:` or `data:` is a rejected configuration rather
//! than something the admin UI has to remember to filter.
