//! `subagent` — one configured agent as one tool (§11.3).
//!
//! The trait that makes an agent a *capability of another agent*: the parent
//! keeps the conversation, hands one bounded task to a specialist, and reads back
//! what it concluded. What the specialist did to get there — the twenty tool
//! calls, the file it read twice, the query it got wrong first — happened in a
//! context window that is not the parent's, and stays there.
//!
//! ## Why this is worth having at all
//!
//! Two reasons, and they are different reasons.
//!
//! - **Context.** A parent that ran the specialist's tools itself would carry
//!   every intermediate result for the rest of the conversation. A parent that
//!   delegates carries one paragraph. This is the reason multi-agent systems
//!   exist at all in practice, and it is why the child does **not** inherit the
//!   parent's transcript: a sub-agent given its parent's history would spend
//!   exactly the tokens the delegation was meant to save.
//! - **Scope.** An agent is a role floor plus a set of traits. "The agent that
//!   may edit the source" and "the agent that may answer customers" want
//!   different tool sets and different floors, and composing them by delegation
//!   keeps each one's definition readable — which is the first question §11.3
//!   says an admin must be able to answer off an agent's record.
//!
//! ## Delegation, not handoff
//!
//! The alternative shape — hand the conversation over, let the specialist own
//! every message from then on — is not what this does, and
//! [`sc_agent::delegate`] records why: a run has one subject and one authority on
//! it, and a transcript that changed agent halfway would be a record of two
//! agents' work under one heading. Here the parent is answerable for the answer.
//!
//! ## The briefing is the whole channel
//!
//! Because the child sees nothing but what this tool sends it, a bare sentence is
//! the failure mode: "look into that" is not a task to an agent that cannot see
//! what "that" was. So the tool asks the model for a **task**, the **context** it
//! cannot otherwise have, and the **output** wanted — the three things a
//! delegated task demonstrably needs — and assembles them into one briefing under
//! headings. A model that is asked for those three writes them; a model handed
//! one free-text field writes a sentence.
//!
//! ## What comes back
//!
//! The sub-agent's final message **verbatim**, its run id, and how many steps it
//! took. Verbatim because a paraphrase is a second chance to lose the finding,
//! and the run id because that is how the transcript is read (`getRun`) rather
//! than by shipping it back into the parent's context.
//!
//! A sub-agent that ended *without* something to hand back — out of steps, or
//! having called tools all turn and then said nothing — comes back as a tool
//! **error**, not as a result with an empty `answer` field. That failure is
//! specific to this pattern and quiet by nature: a parent that reads `answer: ""`
//! as an answer will report to the person that there was nothing to find.
