//! The documentation of Phase 12 against the code it documents.
//!
//! `docs/tutorial-agents.md` tells an admin which boxes to tick and which tool
//! names to look for in a transcript, and `docs/TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md` carries
//! the milestone's "what was built, where it deviates" notes. Both go stale
//! silently: a renamed checkbox or a changed tool-name rule leaves a tutorial
//! that is confidently wrong, which is worse than no tutorial. So the facts the
//! documents assert about the code are asserted here against the code.
//!
//! What this does **not** do is check prose. It checks the names.
