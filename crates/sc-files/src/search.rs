//! Searching a store's text files, server-side (TODO Phase 5, §11.3).
//!
//! Find-in-files over a store used to be the client's job: the IDE walked the
//! tree through the filesystem provider, one HTTP request per directory, and an
//! agent could not do it at all. This module is the walk done **where the bytes
//! are** — one call in, the matches out — and it is the same code both callers
//! use, so what the IDE's search box finds is what the model's `search_files`
//! tool finds.
//!
//! Three things it is deliberately careful about:
//!
//! - **Access is the same rule as everywhere else.** Every directory listing goes
//!   through [`filter_visible`](crate::filter_visible), so a search cannot report
//!   a line from a file the caller could not have opened — which would leak the
//!   contents of exactly the tree an admin restricted, one match at a time.
//! - **It is bounded, in three directions at once.** Results
//!   ([`SearchQuery::max_results`]), file size ([`MAX_FILE_BYTES`]) and files
//!   visited ([`MAX_FILES_SCANNED`]) each have a ceiling, and the outcome says
//!   when one was hit. A search over a store that happens to hold a
//!   `node_modules` must come back, and it must not come back lying about having
//!   looked everywhere.
//! - **Binary files are skipped, not mangled.** A file whose bytes are not UTF-8
//!   has no lines to report, and "matched at line 3" of a PNG is noise in a
//!   result list a person is reading.
