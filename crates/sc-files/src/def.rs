//! [`FileStoreDef`]: the stored *definition* of a file store, as distinct from
//! the connected [`FileStore`](crate::FileStore) instance it produces.
//!
//! The MVP had no such type, because a store existed only as a
//! `--file-store NAME=PATH` process argument: there was nothing to persist and
//! nothing to edit. Making stores admin-editable makes a store an object with a
//! lifecycle — created, edited, deleted, reconnected at boot — and that object
//! needs a value type before it can have a row.
//!
//! The split matters and is worth stating plainly:
//!
//! - A **definition** is inert data: a name, which backend, and that backend's
//!   settings. It is what the admin edits and what a `_sc_file_stores` row
//!   holds. It can describe a store that does not currently work — a path that
//!   has since been unmounted — and that is a state the admin UI must be able to
//!   show and let them fix, not an error to refuse to load.
//! - An **instance** is a live `Arc<dyn FileStore>` in the catalog's registry,
//!   which by existing asserts the store is reachable.
//!
//! Persisting a definition lives in `sc-catalog`, not here: this crate has no
//! `Catalog`, and cannot gain one, since `sc-catalog` already depends on it.
//! Turning a definition into an instance is the backend registry's job (TODO
//! §1.2).
