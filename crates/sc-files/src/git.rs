//! Git-repository [`FileStore`] driver: a store whose contents are a **working
//! tree** cloned from a remote, with the repository operations an admin needs to
//! move changes in and out of it.
//!
//! ## What is new here, and what is not
//!
//! The bytes are on local disk, so everything [`LocalFileStore`] does — reading,
//! writing, listing, the traversal sandbox, xattr metadata — is exactly right
//! and is delegated to it unchanged. What a git store adds is *where the
//! directory comes from* and *what else can be done to it*:
//!
//! - **Where.** The admin supplies a URL, not a path, and the clone lives in an
//!   OS-appropriate data directory ([`data_dir`]) that Saltcorn owns, because a
//!   directory Saltcorn created by cloning is Saltcorn's to place — unlike a
//!   `local` store's directory, which is the admin's own and must be named by
//!   them. An admin who *does* have a place in mind names it in
//!   [`CFG_DIR`](crate::CFG_DIR) when creating the store, and only then: the
//!   setting says where the working tree was put, so changing it afterwards
//!   would abandon that tree rather than move it.
//!
//!   A directory that already holds a checkout is **adopted, not cloned over**
//!   (see [`GitRepo::ensure_cloned`]). That is what makes the URL optional: a
//!   repository someone has already cloned onto the server is connected by
//!   naming its directory and leaving the URL blank, and the remote — if it has
//!   one — is the one the checkout already points at.
//! - **What else.** [`GitRepo`] carries `pull`, `push`, `stage`, `unstage`,
//!   `commit` and `status`. These are not [`FileStore`] methods and deliberately
//!   so: the
//!   trait is the contract every backend answers, and three quarters of its
//!   implementations will never have a remote to push to. A caller that wants
//!   git operations asks for a git repository.
//!
//! ## Authentication: a generated deploy key
//!
//! Cloning a private repository over SSH needs a key the remote will accept, and
//! the flow that works for a hosted repository is the *deploy key*: generate a
//! keypair here, hand the admin the public half to paste into the repository's
//! settings, keep the private half. So [`generate_deploy_key`] exists and is
//! called **before** the store is saved — the admin must be able to install the
//! key at the remote before anything tries to clone, or the first clone fails
//! for a reason that has nothing to do with their configuration.
//!
//! The private key is written to [`key_dir`] with `0600` permissions on Unix and
//! is never returned by the API; only the public half is, which is the half that
//! is meant to be copied around.
//!
//! ## Every git invocation is non-interactive
//!
//! A server has no terminal, so a git subprocess that asks a question does not
//! get an answer — it hangs, holding a request open until something times out.
//! Every invocation therefore runs with `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0`, and every
//! invocation using a deploy key runs ssh with `BatchMode=yes`, so a missing or
//! rejected credential is an immediate error carrying git's own message rather
//! than a stall.
