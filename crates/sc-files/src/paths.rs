//!
//! Two backends need a place on disk that the admin did not name: the git
//! backend clones into one ([`clone_dir`](crate::clone_dir)), and the local
//! backend *suggests* one ([`suggest_local_dir`]) to an admin who has no opinion
//! about where a store's files should live. Both answers descend from the same
//! [`data_dir`], so an operator who moves one moves all of them, and the
//! server's own data stays in one place rather than two.
