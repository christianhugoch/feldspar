//! The file-store **backend registry**: which backends exist, what settings each
//! declares, and how a [`FileStoreDef`] becomes a connected [`FileStore`].
//!
//! This is the same "settings as data" move that makes "the admin picks a
//! framework" work (design §13.3), applied to stores. The admin UI must render a
//! settings form for a backend it knows nothing about — including one supplied
//! later by a guest language through `sc-code` — with no per-backend special
//! case. So a backend declares its settings as [`FormField`]s, the one
//! vocabulary §6.2 gives every configurable extension point, and the UI renders
//! whatever it is handed.
//!
//! The MVP registers exactly one backend, [`LOCAL_BACKEND`]. The registry is not
//! ceremony for that one case: it is what makes adding S3 or a git remote a
//! change *here* rather than a change in the admin UI.
//!
//! ## Two kinds of wrong, kept apart
//!
//! A store's configuration can be wrong in two quite different ways, and
//! conflating them would make the admin UI unusable:
//!
//! - **Structurally wrong** — a missing `path`, a `path` that is a number, a
//!   setting the backend has never heard of, an unknown backend. This is the
//!   admin's typo, it is knowable without touching the filesystem, and it is
//!   always the same answer on every machine. [`validate_file_store_config`]
//!   catches it, and `save_file_store` refuses the save, so the mistake is
//!   caught while the admin is still looking at the form.
//! - **Currently unreachable** — a perfectly well-formed definition whose
//!   directory has been unmounted, renamed, or not created yet. This is not a
//!   typo and often not the admin's fault; it can become true *after* a
//!   successful save, and it can stop being true without anything being edited.
//!   [`connect_from_def`] reports it.
//!
//! Only the first blocks a save. That is deliberate and follows from §1.1's
//! model: a definition is inert data that may describe a store which does not
//! currently work, and such a store must stay listable and **editable** — an
//! admin whose disk was unmounted needs to be able to open that store and fix
//! its path, which they could not do if saving demanded a reachable directory.
//! So reachability is reported, never enforced at save time.
