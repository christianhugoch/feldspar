//! The admin SPA's theme is **Tabler**, vendored as CSS, and that has two
//! properties the server depends on and neither the Rust nor the TypeScript
//! compiler can check.
//!
//! 1. **It is same-origin-clean.** Every response carries `style-src 'self'`
//!    and `font-src 'self'` (see `security::CONTENT_SECURITY_POLICY`), so a
//!    stylesheet that `@import`s a webfont or references a remote image is not
//!    a cosmetic regression — the browser refuses to load it and the admin UI
//!    renders unstyled. Tabler's own templates *do* `@import` Inter from
//!    `rsms.me`, so this is a live hazard on the next theme upgrade, and this
//!    test is what catches it.
//! 2. **It is what the bundle actually loads.** The stylesheet is only served
//!    because `main.tsx` imports it; an import left pointing at Bootstrap's
//!    plain stylesheet would type-check, build and lose the entire theme.
//!
//! Like the other `ui/admin` tests, this reads the checked-in source rather
//! than a build, so it needs no Node toolchain.
// `allow-expect-in-tests` covers `#[cfg(test)]` modules and not an integration
// test's own body, so every test file in this crate says so for itself.
