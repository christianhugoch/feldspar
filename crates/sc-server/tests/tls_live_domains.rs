//! The certificate's name set is **live**: creating an application puts its
//! subdomain on the certificate without a restart (design §13.5).
//!
//! An application is served on a subdomain of the base domain, and a subdomain
//! the certificate does not cover is a name a browser refuses before it reads a
//! byte of the app. The ACME client takes its domain list at construction, so
//! this used to be settled at boot and an application created afterwards was
//! served on a name nothing had certified — which made restarting the server
//! look like part of creating an application.
//!
//! Two claims, one per half of the seam:
//!
//! - [`AppMounts`] tells the certificate what is served on every mount and
//!   unmount, and installing one orders nothing (the boot path's first order
//!   already covers what it mounted).
//! - [`AcmeCertificate`] turns that into a name set that **grows** — the union of
//!   what it covers and what is served — and never shrinks while the process
//!   runs, because each order is charged against the CA's rate limits and a name
//!   that has stopped being served resolves to nothing either way.
//!
//! Neither reaches a CA: the certificate here is pointed at a directory URL
//! nothing answers on, because what is under test is the name set, not ACME.
