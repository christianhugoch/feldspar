//! `saltcorn serve` under a `Type=notify` service manager, end to end.
//!
//! The unit tests in `sc-server`'s `systemd` module assert the *protocol* — what
//! each notification looks like on the wire. What they cannot assert is the one
//! thing `Type=notify` is bought for: that `READY=1` means **the port is
//! open**. A readiness notification sent a moment too early is worse than none,
//! because every unit ordered `After=saltcorn.service` is then released into a
//! connection refused.
//!
//! So this test stands the real [`sc_server::serve`] up with a real
//! `NOTIFY_SOCKET` behind it, and checks the three moments an operator's unit
//! file depends on:
//!
//! 1. `READY=1` arrives, and a TCP connection to the bind address succeeds *at
//!    that moment* — the listener was bound before the notification, not after.
//! 2. `WATCHDOG=1` keeps arriving on its own, at the interval `WATCHDOG_USEC`
//!    implies, which is what makes `WatchdogSec` in the unit safe to set.
//! 3. `STOPPING=1` arrives when the process is sent `SIGTERM`, so the unit shows
//!    `deactivating` for the graceful drain rather than looking hung.
//!
//! Unix only: on a platform with no Unix datagram sockets there is no service
//! manager to talk to, and the implementation is compiled out.
