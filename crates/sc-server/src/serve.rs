//! Binding the listener and running the server with graceful shutdown
//! (technical design §16), over TLS where it is configured (§13.5).
//!
//! Two signals matter to a running server: `SIGTERM` (or Ctrl-C) stops it, and
//! `SIGHUP` reloads the catalog and the applications in place without building
//! anything — see [`crate::reload`].
//!
//! The service manager is told when both of those are true: `READY=1` goes out
//! once every listener is bound and accepting, and `STOPPING=1` when the
//! shutdown signal arrives, so a unit may say `Type=notify` and `WatchdogSec`
//! and mean them (see [`crate::systemd`]). Where there is no service manager —
//! every development run, and every platform without one — the notifications are
//! no-ops and this function behaves exactly as it did before.
//!
//! With TLS on there are **two** listeners: the configured bind address, which
//! answers plain HTTP, and the TLS port beside it. What the plain one serves is
//! the admin's choice — a permanent redirect to HTTPS (the default) or the
//! application itself, for a deployment that is also reachable over a private
//! network. Both stop together on the one shutdown signal.
