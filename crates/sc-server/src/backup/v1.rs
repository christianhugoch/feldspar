//! Reading a **Saltcorn 1** backup.
//!
//! A v1 archive is a different file with the same job: `pack.json` holds the
//! application's metadata (tables, their fields, triggers, roles — and a good
//! deal this system has no counterpart for), `tables/<name>.json` holds the rows,
//! `files.csv` plus `files/<name>` hold the uploads, and `config/<key>` holds one
//! setting each.
//!
//! **Nothing here restores anything.** This module *translates*: it reads a v1
//! archive and produces the entries a Feldspar backup would have had
//! ([`convert`]), and the restorer then does what it always does. That is the
//! whole design. A second restore path would be a second set of answers to "what
//! happens when the table is already here", "which parser validates this field",
//! "what does the report say" — and the answers would drift. This way an import
//! is inspected by the same dialog, narrowed by the same selection, and reported
//! in the same lines as any other restore.
//!
//! ## What is imported, and what is not
//!
//! The kinds this system has: **tables**, their **fields**, their **rows**,
//! **triggers** (v1 calls them actions), **files** and **users** — and the
//! **views**, **pages**, **library** and **menu**, which become one **Saltcorn
//! UI application** named after the site (TODO "Saltcorn UI" §13, "The builder"
//! §8). A view's configuration, a page's layout and a library item's layout cross
//! unchanged apart from the two rewrites below: they are what v1's own `list.ts`
//! reads, and the Saltcorn UI framework runs v1's own `list.ts`.
//! v1's page groups, tags, models, plugins and event logs have no counterpart,
//! and a half-translation of them would be worse than their absence.
//! Everything left out — every field whose type has no counterpart, every menu
//! entry that opens v1's admin UI — becomes a line in the restore report rather
//! than a silence.
//!
//! ## Translations that are not mechanical
//!
//! - **Users are keyed differently.** v1 numbers users; this system gives them
//!   UUIDs (§7.1). Each imported account therefore gets a fresh UUID *here*, in
//!   the converter, so that every foreign key pointing at it in every other table
//!   can be rewritten to match in the same pass — and keeps its old number in a
//!   `legacy_id` column, which is the only way to recognise the same person in
//!   the v1 database afterwards.
//! - **Files need a store.** v1 has one file area per application; this system
//!   has named stores (§6). The uploads are put into a local store named after
//!   the application (`site_name`), created if it is not already there — and left
//!   exactly as it is if it is, like every other restored store.
//! - **Library items are keyed differently too** (TODO "The builder" §8). A v1
//!   layout places an item as `{ type: "library", library_id: 3 }`, a serial of
//!   v1's `_sc_library`; here an item's id is a UUID. Each item gets one here, and
//!   every `library_id` in every view's configuration, page's layout and item's
//!   own layout is rewritten to it in the same pass ([`LibraryKeys`]).
//! - **A page's legacy fixed states are folded into its layout** (§7). v1 has
//!   two spellings of an embedded view's fixed state: `configuration` on the
//!   `view` segment, which the builder writes, and the page's `fixed_states`,
//!   which older builders wrote and v1's page editor folds into the segments
//!   before opening the builder. The import does that fold once, and
//!   `fixed_states` is not kept, so this system has one spelling.
//!
//! Those two rewrites are the only places where "a layout crosses unchanged"
//! gives way, and each is v1's own reading of the data rather than a new one.
//!
//! Password hashes are deliberately **not** carried: v1 hashes with bcrypt and
//! this system with argon2id, and a bcrypt string in `password_hash` would not be
//! a password that works, it would be a login that fails with an error. Imported
//! accounts arrive with no password and are told to be given one.
