//! Bringing the agents up at boot (§11.2, §11.4).
//!
//! The twin of [`triggers`](crate::triggers), and for the same reason: the trait
//! seam is in `sc-agent` (layer 7), the built-in traits are in `sc-core-traits`
//! (layer 9, above the row layer so a trait's write goes through `sc-api`), and
//! neither knows about the other. This is where they are put together, once, by
//! the process that is going to serve requests.
//!
//! What is assembled here is [`AgentServices`]: the trait registry every agent's
//! configuration is validated against, and **how an agent's provider is
//! connected**. The second is a seam rather than a call because every test of
//! the chat socket has to drive a whole turn without a vendor and without
//! spending a token (decision 7) — see
//! [`ProviderConnector`](sc_agent::ProviderConnector), which lives in `sc-agent`
//! because the `run_agent` action (§11.5) needs the same seam for the same
//! reason and sits below this crate.
