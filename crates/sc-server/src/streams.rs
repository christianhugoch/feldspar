//! Streams on a running server: the supervisor, and the bridge that turns a
//! delivered element into a **trigger event** (TODO "Streams" §8, task 5.3).
//!
//! `sc-stream` is at layer 6 so a module can supply a stream provider — the
//! same placement argument `sc-model` and `sc-action` carry — and the price is
//! that it knows nothing about triggers, applications or sockets. So it
//! declares [`StreamConsumer`](sc_stream::StreamConsumer) and this is where the
//! seam is filled in, exactly as `sc-model` declares `DatasetSource` and
//! [`models`](crate::models) supplies it.
//!
//! [`StreamServices`] is the assembly [`ModelServices`](crate::ModelServices)
//! and [`AgentServices`](crate::AgentServices) already are: the provider
//! registry, the supervisor holding one subscription per enabled stream, and
//! the numbers this process was started with. It rides on
//! [`AppMounts`](crate::AppMounts) with the other five for the reason they do —
//! the admin handlers and the observe sockets both already hold that handle.
//!
//! ## Nobody may block the flow (§7)
//!
//! [`TriggerBridge`] is the one consumer a server installs, and its whole job
//! is to **not wait**. `consume` returns immediately: it fires the dispatcher on
//! a spawned task and, if the last element's firing has not finished, it returns
//! [`Delivery::Dropped`] rather than queueing. That is `Scheduler`'s rule for a
//! missed occurrence, for `Scheduler`'s reason — "five queued copies of a report
//! nobody read is worse than one late one" — and the alternative is an unbounded
//! queue in front of a trigger, which is a memory leak with a delay built into
//! it. The drop is **counted**, on the running stream, and shown on the Streams
//! list: a stream that is dropping is a thing you can see.
//!
//! An element whose stream has no trigger listening costs nothing: the bridge
//! asks the live trigger set first, and a stream nobody triggers on spawns no
//! task at all.
//!
//! ## One process, one subscription
//!
//! Two servers against one database both subscribe, so a stream trigger fires
//! twice. That is `sc-stream`'s §6 limitation, said out loud again here because
//! this module is where it becomes visible: the duplicate is two *firings*, and
//! a trigger that inserts a row inserts two. `sc-bus` does not exist, and until
//! it does a flow is process-local.
