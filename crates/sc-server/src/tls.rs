//! Terminating TLS in-process: pasted certificates and ACME (design §13.5).
//!
//! The server serves HTTPS itself, so a deployment needs no reverse proxy in
//! front of it — and the admin UI and every application get the same treatment,
//! because they are one listener with a `Host` router behind it. Certificates
//! come from one of two places, chosen by the `ssl_mode` setting:
//!
//! - **`custom`** — a chain and a key the admin pasted into the settings screen.
//!   They are parsed into a [`rustls::ServerConfig`] and that is the whole of it:
//!   no ACME traffic, nothing to renew.
//! - **`letsencrypt`** — [`rustls_acme`] obtains and renews certificates from an
//!   ACME CA, answering the **TLS-ALPN-01** challenge inside the handshake it is
//!   already terminating. That choice of challenge is why there is no `/.well-
//!   known/acme-challenge` route anywhere in the router: the validation never
//!   reaches HTTP, so there is nothing to keep in step and nothing an
//!   application's own routes could shadow.
//!
//! Both arrive at the listener as an `axum_server` acceptor, which is why this
//! crate serves through `axum-server` when TLS is on and through `axum::serve`
//! when it is off — one accept seam, two ways of filling it.
//!
//! **ALPN advertises `http/1.1` only, on purpose.** The admin UI's agent chat
//! and the IDE's language server are WebSockets, and a WebSocket over HTTP/2
//! needs RFC 8441's extended CONNECT, which axum's `ws` does not implement.
//! Advertising `h2` would therefore trade two working features for a
//! multiplexing win on an admin console. If HTTP/2 is wanted for an
//! application's API, that is a reverse proxy's job today. In ACME mode
//! `acme-tls/1` is advertised beside it, because the same listener answers the
//! CA's validation handshake: a client that offers only that protocol is the CA,
//! and it is served the challenge certificate the resolver holds.
//!
//! **The certificates are checked where they are pasted.** [`check_certificate`]
//! is what the settings endpoint calls before saving: a key that does not match
//! its chain fails in front of the admin, not at the next restart when nobody is
//! watching and the symptom is a server that will not bind.
//!
//! **The ACME name set is live.** A certificate covers the base domain, every
//! mounted application's subdomain and whatever else the admin listed — and an
//! application is created while the server runs, so that set changes while the
//! server runs. [`AcmeCertificate`] is what makes it a new order rather than a
//! restart: [`AppMounts`](crate::AppMounts) reports every mount and unmount to
//! it (through the [`Certificate`] seam), and a name that is not covered yet
//! starts a fresh order for the union of the old names and the new one. Until
//! that order finishes the **previous certificate keeps serving**, so adding an
//! application never takes the ones already up off the air.
