//! Build targets run as **background jobs** (design §13.3).
//!
//! A web build is a minute of a bundler; an Android APK is up to a quarter of an
//! hour of Gradle. Holding one HTTP request open for that is at the mercy of
//! every proxy, browser and reload between the admin and the server, and a
//! request that is dropped loses the result while the build carries on without
//! an owner. So starting a target build answers at once, the build runs as a
//! task of its own, and the admin UI asks how it is going until it is done.
//!
//! One job per application and target, **started at most once at a time**:
//! pressing the button again while a build is running — from another tab, or
//! after a reload — answers the running job instead of starting a second Gradle
//! in the same project directory. The last job is kept after it finishes, so a
//! page that polls a moment late still reads the outcome.
//!
//! The registry lives in this process and nowhere else. A restart ends the
//! builds it was running (their processes are killed with the server) and
//! forgets their outcomes; the artifact of a finished one is still in the file
//! store, which is the record that matters.
