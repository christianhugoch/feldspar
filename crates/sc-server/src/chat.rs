//! The admin chat socket: one agent, one conversation, streamed (§11.4).
//!
//! **Why a WebSocket at all**, when everything else in the admin API is a typed
//! request/response pair (§13.1): a chat turn is bidirectional. Text, reasoning,
//! tool calls and tool results go out *while* a new message or a stop may come
//! in, and the endpoint model has no shape for that. So the turn is a socket and
//! everything around it — listing agents, listing runs, reading an old one — stays
//! a typed endpoint, which is the same split the file-store IDE's language server
//! made (§12.1) and is authenticated the same way: admin-only, through the session
//! cookie, decided before the upgrade.
//!
//! ## The protocol
//!
//! The client sends, as JSON text frames:
//!
//! - `{"type":"start","agent":"librarian","run":"<uuid>"?}` — which agent this
//!   socket is talking to, optionally continuing an existing run.
//! - `{"type":"message","text":"…"}` — one user turn.
//! - `{"type":"abort"}` — stop the turn that is running.
//!
//! The server sends:
//!
//! - `{"type":"text","delta":"…"}` / `{"type":"reasoning","delta":"…"}`
//! - `{"type":"tool_call","id":…,"name":…,"arguments":{…}}`
//! - `{"type":"tool_result","id":…,"name":…,"content":"…","is_error":bool}`
//! - `{"type":"done","run":"<uuid>","state":"done"|"failed"|"aborted","answer":"…",
//!   "conclusion":"answered"|"max_steps"|"aborted"|"over_budget"?,"budget":"cost"|"wall_time"|"context"?}`
//!   — `conclusion` is present when the loop concluded, and `budget` names the
//!   budget an `over_budget` run ran out of.
//! - `{"type":"error","message":"…"}`
//!
//! ## A failure is an event, not a dropped connection
//!
//! A provider that refuses, a key that is wrong, an agent that names a trait
//! configured against a table that has been dropped: each arrives as an `error`
//! event on an **open** socket, followed by the `done` that ends the turn. A chat
//! window that silently stops is unfixable by the person watching it, and a
//! closed socket is indistinguishable from a network that dropped. The only
//! things closed with a reason are the two conditions under which no chat is
//! possible at all — a server with no catalog, or none with agents installed.
//!
//! ## Aborting
//!
//! The turn is driven inside a `select!` against the socket's own receiver, so a
//! stop is read while the model is still streaming. Dropping the drive future
//! drops the provider stream with it, and what the run had already done is on the
//! row — every step wrote one (§11.2) — so the transcript the history shows after
//! a stop is the transcript up to the stop.
