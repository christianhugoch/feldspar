//! The file-store IDE's TypeScript language server (design §12.1, phase 4).
//!
//! Semantics — errors, completions, go-to-definition — come from a **real
//! `typescript-language-server` process on the server**, not from tsserver in a
//! web worker. The reason is where `node_modules` is: the project's dependencies
//! and its `tsconfig.json` are already on the server's disk, and type-checking
//! against them there costs one process, while type-checking against them in the
//! browser would mean dragging the whole type surface across HTTP.
//!
//! That makes this the one IDE capability gated on
//! [`FileStore::local_path`](sc_files::FileStore::local_path), exactly as a
//! framework's build step is (§13.3). A store with no local path gets editing,
//! formatting, grammars and syntax errors — and is *told* it gets no semantics,
//! which is what the close frame below carries.
//!
//! ## The shape of the bridge
//!
//! One WebSocket, one process. The socket carries **bare JSON-RPC messages**
//! (what `vscode-ws-jsonrpc` speaks); the process speaks LSP's `Content-Length`
//! framing over stdio. So each direction is a translation of the framing, plus one
//! translation of *URIs*:
//!
//! The workbench edits the store as the workspace folder `/<store>` (§12.1's
//! filesystem provider), while the language server sees the store's real directory
//! on disk. Both halves are `file://` URIs and neither can be talked out of its
//! own, so the bridge — the one place that knows both — rewrites them as messages
//! pass. Doing it here rather than in the browser keeps the server's directory
//! layout out of the page, and keeps the workspace folder the same `/<store>` for
//! every backend rather than only for the ones with a local path.
//!
//! ## Refusals
//!
//! Everything decidable before the upgrade is decided before it, but only an
//! **authentication** failure is answered with an HTTP status: a browser cannot
//! read the body of a failed WebSocket handshake, so a reason sent that way would
//! be lost. Every other refusal — no such store, no local path, no installed
//! dependencies, too many servers already running — upgrades the socket and then
//! closes it with the reason in the close frame, which the IDE shows to the admin
//! once (`languageClient.ts`).
