//! The `users` table: its schema and one-time bootstrap.
//!
//! Per GOALS and technical design §7.1 the users table lives in the primary
//! database and is deliberately minimal:
//!
//! - The primary key is a **UUID** and is **not deletable**. Code MUST NOT
//!   assume any other field exists.
//! - An [`email`](COL_EMAIL) field exists initially, but the admin MAY later
//!   delete it and substitute another identifier field.
//! - Passwords are stored hashed with argon2id in [`password_hash`](COL_PASSWORD_HASH).
//! - [`role`](COL_ROLE) is an integer **1–100**; `1` = admin (full access),
//!   `100` = public (not logged in). Admins MAY add arbitrary fields. It is a
//!   **foreign key onto [`_fd_roles`](crate::ROLES_TABLE)** — a role is a row
//!   that can carry a name and role-specific settings, and a user whose role
//!   names nothing would be a user whose privileges cannot be described.
//!
//! The bootstrap is driver-agnostic: it goes through the [`Catalog`] like any
//! other table creation, and it invents no database-specific defaults — the
//! UUID primary key is generated in Rust when a user is created (a later TODO
//! item), not by a Postgres `gen_random_uuid()` default.
