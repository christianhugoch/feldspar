//! Changing a user after it exists: edit, delete, disable, reset the password
//! (technical design §7.1).
//!
//! [`create_user_with`](crate::create_user_with) is the other half; everything
//! here operates on a user the caller has already identified by id. Two rules run
//! through all of it:
//!
//! - **The id is not a field.** Every operation addresses the row by its UUID
//!   primary key, which no payload gets to reassign — the users table's one
//!   non-deletable column (§7.1) is also its one fixed identity.
//! - **The system's columns are not the admin's.** An admin may add columns to
//!   the users table and edit them here through `extra`, but
//!   [`SYSTEM_USER_COLUMNS`](crate::SYSTEM_USER_COLUMNS) are reached only through
//!   the named operations: the role through [`UserUpdate::role`], the password
//!   through [`set_user_password`], the disabled flag through
//!   [`set_user_disabled`]. Writing the password hash through a bag of column
//!   values is exactly the hole that rule closes.
//!
//! **Nothing here touches sessions**, deliberately. Disabling or deleting a user
//! must also drop the credentials already handed out, but that is
//! [`SessionStore::end_user_sessions`](crate::SessionStore::end_user_sessions)'s
//! job: it evicts the calling node's cache as well as the rows, and only the
//! server holds the store. Doing half of it here would look like the whole of it.
