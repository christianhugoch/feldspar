//! API tokens: the bearer credential the administration MCP server
//! authenticates with (design §13.6).
//!
//! # One authorization model, not two
//!
//! A token **names a user**. Not a principal, not a service account, not a role:
//! [`authenticate_api_token`] returns the [`User`] the token was minted for, and
//! from there nothing is different — every `AuthRequirement`, every ownership
//! formula and every row-level-security rule applies because it applies to that
//! user. The alternative, a second notion of who may do what, would be a second
//! answer to a question this crate and §7.3 already answer, and the two would
//! drift within a release.
//!
//! The cost, accepted knowingly, is that a token outlives its owner's attention.
//! Expiry, revocation and §13.6's audit line are what that cost is paid with.
//!
//! # What is stored, and what is not
//!
//! What the row holds is the **SHA-256 of the token, never the token**, for
//! exactly the reason [`crate::session`] gives: a bearer credential at rest is a
//! thing worth stealing and a hash of one is not. A fast hash is the right one —
//! the token is 256 bits of uniform randomness, so there is no dictionary to run
//! and nothing a slow hash (argon2id, which is for passwords) would buy.
//!
//! Three details that are decisions rather than defaults:
//!
//! - **The wire format is prefixed**: [`TOKEN_PREFIX`] and then the base64url of
//!   the random bytes. A prefix is what makes the credential greppable by a
//!   secret scanner and obvious in a paste, and it costs five characters.
//! - **It is shown once.** [`mint_api_token`] returns it in
//!   [`MintedApiToken::secret`] and nothing here ever reads it back, because
//!   nothing can. [`ApiToken`] — the value a list is made of — has no field for
//!   it and no field for the hash either, which is what makes "the plaintext is
//!   not recoverable" a property of the *type* rather than of everyone's care.
//! - **`last_used_at` is written at most once a minute per token**
//!   ([`LAST_USED_THROTTLE_SECONDS`]). A session writes *nothing* per request and
//!   §7.2 says why; a token is rarer and its last use is worth more, but a write
//!   on every tool call is still a write on the request path.
//!
//! Unlike `_sc_sessions` this table is **logged**: a lost session costs a
//! re-login and a lost token costs a support call.
//!
//! # The identifier a list carries
//!
//! §13.6's column list is the hash, the user, the label, the grants and the four
//! timestamps. There is one column here it does not name — an `id` — and it is
//! here because the hash must not leave the table and something has to name a
//! row for the Revoke button. A label is what an admin *calls* a token and two
//! tokens may share one; the id is what a request means by "that one".
//!
//! # Lookup reads the user
//!
//! Every refusal in [`authenticate_api_token`] has its own message, because each
//! is a different thing for the holder to do about it, and the token's *user* is
//! read on every lookup rather than copied into the row. So a token whose user
//! is deleted, disabled or demoted below [`ROLE_ADMIN`] stops working at the next
//! call — the same rule, and the same argument, as the session cache's.
