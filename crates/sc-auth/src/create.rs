//! Creating an ordinary user (technical design §7.1).
//!
//! This is the admin-driven counterpart to [`create_first_user`](crate::create_first_user):
//! it mints a user with a caller-supplied [`role`](crate::COL_ROLE) rather than
//! forcing [admin](crate::ROLE_ADMIN), and it does **not** require the users
//! table to be empty. The UUID id is generated in Rust (not by a database
//! default) and the password is hashed with argon2id before it is stored.
//!
//! The users table is the one table an admin is invited to add columns to, so
//! creating a user is not four fixed values: [`NewUser::extra`] carries whatever
//! else the table has, and the caller — which has the catalog, and therefore the
//! column types — hands the values over already coerced.
