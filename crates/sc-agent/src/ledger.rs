//! The [`Ledger`]: what each step of a run cost, and who answered it (TODO §10).
//!
//! Part of the loop's state, so it is stored with the run and survives a
//! resume. Each model call adds one [`LedgerStep`] with its role, usage, cost and
//! time. A delegated child run's totals are rolled up into its parent's as a
//! [`ChildLedger`], so a planner's totals include every session it started.
//!
//! **An unknown cost is not zero.** A step whose model has no price records
//! `None`, and any total that includes one is `None` too: a cost budget cannot
//! be kept against a number that is missing a term. That is why a cost budget
//! is refused on save for an agent with an unpriced model.
