//! `sc-agent` — agents, traits and the loop (design §11.2).
//!
//! Layer 7. This crate knows **agents, traits and the loop, and nothing about
//! which vendor is on the other end** — that is [`sc_llm`]'s, below it. It also
//! knows nothing about *which* traits exist: it defines what a trait is, and the
//! built-in set lives in `sc-core-traits` at layer 9, above the row layer, so a
//! trait that writes a row goes through `sc-api` and its write is coerced,
//! validated and observed like any other.
//!
//! ## What is here
//!
//! - The **record** ([`agent`], [`store`], [`validate`]): [`Agent`], `_fd_agents`,
//!   and one validation function run on save *and* on load. An agent that fails
//!   is dropped from the live set ([`Agents`]) with its reason kept, and stays
//!   stored, listed and editable — editing it is the repair.
//! - The **extension point** ([`agent_trait`], [`registry`]): [`AgentTrait`] and
//!   [`AgentRegistry`], the twin of `sc-action`'s `ActionRegistry`.
//! - The **loop** ([`machine`]): [`AgentLoop`], a steppable, serialisable state
//!   machine that decides and does no IO.
//! - **The context** ([`context`]): the request layout (stable prefix, session
//!   header, history), the context budget, and clearing and compacting to keep
//!   within it — as overlays, so the stored transcript stays whole.
//! - **Loop control** ([`control`], [`schema`]): fingerprints, the doom-loop
//!   detectors, the malformed-call cap, trait [`Signal`]s and the escalation
//!   ladder, plus the check of a call's arguments against its tool's schema.
//! - The **driver** ([`driver`]): [`Runner`], the one thing that does IO for it —
//!   streams the provider, dispatches tools as the run's caller, and writes
//!   `_fd_runs` after every step.
//! - The **run** ([`run`], [`run_store`]): [`Run`] and `_fd_runs`, in the shape
//!   §10.3's workflow engine will also use.
//! - **Delegation** ([`delegate`]): [`Delegator`], the capability a run offers a
//!   trait that names *another agent* — a child run, under the same authority,
//!   with a context of its own and a bound on how deep the chain may go.
//! - **Looking at an application** ([`view`]): the preview-mount and browser
//!   seams a trait reaches through [`TraitContext`], implemented by the server.
//! - A **scripted provider** ([`testing`], behind the `testing` feature), because
//!   no test in this tree may need an API key or spend a token.
//!
//! ## The two decisions worth knowing before reading
//!
//! **The loop is a machine, not an `async fn`.** The state is a value, so it is
//! what `_fd_runs` stores and a resumed run is a loaded one. See [`machine`].
//!
//! **A tool runs as the caller, not as the server.** [`RunCaller`] travels with
//! the run and there is no default: a chat turn carries the person and a
//! triggered run carries the trigger's authority, so §7.3's ownership and RLS
//! apply inside an agent exactly as they do outside it.
