//! The [`Run`]: one execution of an agent, as the thing that is stored (§11.4).
//!
//! A run is *not* an agent's private bookkeeping. It is the chat transcript the
//! panel reloads, the record a triggered run leaves behind, and — once §10.3
//! lands — the same row a durable workflow suspends into. That is why
//! [`RunKind`] exists now, with a `workflow` variant nothing produces yet: the
//! shape is decided once, here, rather than discovered later by a second
//! mechanism growing alongside this one.
//!
//! The state that makes a run resumable is [`AgentLoop`], serialised into
//! [`context`](Run::context). Everything else on the row is about the run rather
//! than in it: who it was for, what it is of, whether it is still going.
