//! The loop, as a **steppable machine** rather than an `async fn` (§11.2,
//! decision 8).
//!
//! [`AgentLoop`] owns every *decision* the loop makes — what to send, when to run
//! tools, when to stop — and performs no IO at all. A driver advances it by
//! asking [`next_step`](AgentLoop::next_step) what to do and feeding the result
//! back through [`model_answered`](AgentLoop::model_answered) or
//! [`tool_results`](AgentLoop::tool_results):
//!
//! ```text
//! next_step() ──▶ CallModel { messages }  ──▶ model_answered(assistant)
//!             ──▶ CallTools { calls }     ──▶ tool_results(outcomes)
//!             ──▶ Done(conclusion)
//! ```
//!
//! ## Why this shape
//!
//! Because the whole state is a value, it is `Serialize + Deserialize`, and *the
//! state is what `_fd_runs` stores*. A run persisted after every step is
//! therefore a run that resumes: load it, ask for the next step, carry on. An
//! `async fn` holding the same state on its stack could do the work but not the
//! resuming, and §10.3's durable engine would then need a second mechanism to do
//! what this one already does. The shape is borrowed from `rig-agent`'s sans-IO
//! `AgentRun`; the crate is not (§11.1 records why).
//!
//! It also makes the loop testable without a provider, a database or a runtime:
//! every test in this module is synchronous, and the ones that need a model use
//! the [`FakeProvider`](crate::testing::FakeProvider) through the driver.
//!
//! ## What it deliberately does not decide
//!
//! The system prompt and the tool list are **not** in the state. They are rebuilt
//! from the agent's definition on every turn, because an agent is editable while
//! its runs exist: a conversation resumed after a trait was added must get the
//! new tool, not the one that was current when it started.
