//! Validating an [`Agent`] before it is stored — and again when it is loaded.
//!
//! Every way an agent can be wrong is checked in one place, and checked **on
//! save**, because that is when the admin is standing in front of the form: a
//! provider that is not connected, a trait nothing implements, a configuration
//! the trait does not declare, a table the trait names that no longer exists, two
//! enabled traits whose tools would collide. Discovering any of those mid-answer
//! means an agent that fails — or, worse, quietly answers without the tool it was
//! built around.
//!
//! The same function runs at **load** ([`Agents`]), where an agent that no longer
//! validates is dropped from the live set with its reason kept. That is the
//! fail-closed reading a trigger's load takes, for the same reason.
