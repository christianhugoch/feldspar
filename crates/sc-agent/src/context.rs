//! The context a request carries: its layout, its budget, and how it is kept
//! within that budget by clearing and compacting (TODO §9).
//!
//! ## The layout
//!
//! A request runs from most to least stable, so that each part can be cached
//! behind the one before it:
//!
//! 1. **The stable prefix:** the agent's prompt, each trait's static
//!    contribution and the tools in name order. The driver builds it.
//! 2. **The session header:** a first user-side message that traits build
//!    **once per session** through [`AgentTrait::session_header`]. It is stored
//!    here with the run, so neither step 2 nor a resume rebuilds it.
//! 3. **The history**, append-only.
//!
//! ## The stored transcript stays whole
//!
//! Nothing here edits [`AgentLoop`](crate::AgentLoop)'s messages. Clearing and
//! compacting are **overlays** kept beside them: a stub per cleared tool result,
//! keyed by the result's index, and `(up_to_index, summary)` records. The request
//! is built from the transcript plus the overlays, while the chat and the admin
//! read the transcript itself, with a marker where each compaction happened.
//!
//! ## The budget
//!
//! A request is measured as the `input_tokens` the provider reported for the
//! previous one, plus a calibrated estimate of what has changed since
//! ([`ContextState::measure`]). At [`COMPACT_PERCENT`] of the budget the loop
//! compacts before the next model call:
//!
//! - **Pass 1** replaces every old tool result with the stub its trait writes
//!   through [`AgentTrait::elide`], all in one batch, so the cache breaks once
//!   rather than on every step.
//! - **Pass 2**, only when pass 1 left the request at or above
//!   [`SUMMARY_PERCENT`], has the cheap role summarise everything before the
//!   last K turns ([`ATTR_KEEP_TURNS`]).
//!
//! A request still over the whole budget after that ends the run as
//! [`Budget::Context`](crate::Budget::Context).
//!
//! [`AgentTrait::session_header`]: crate::AgentTrait::session_header
//! [`AgentTrait::elide`]: crate::AgentTrait::elide
