//! The run, as a **steppable machine** rather than an `async fn` (§10.3,
//! decision 4).
//!
//! [`WorkflowRun`] owns every *decision* a run makes — which step is next, what
//! goes in the context, when to give up on a failing step, when the run is over —
//! and performs no IO at all. A driver advances it by asking
//! [`next_step`](WorkflowRun::next_step) what to do, doing it, and feeding the
//! outcome back:
//!
//! ```text
//! next_step() ──▶ RunAction { action, configuration } ──▶ step_succeeded(value)
//!                                                    └──▶ step_failed(error)
//!             ──▶ Evaluate  { formulas }             ──▶ evaluated(values)
//!             ──▶ Suspend   { until, awaiting_input } ─▶ (the clock, or resumed(input))
//!             ──▶ Done      { context }
//!             ──▶ Failed    { step, error }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Why this shape
//!
//! Because the whole state is a value, it is `Serialize + Deserialize`, and *the
//! state is what `_sc_runs.context` stores*. A run written after every step is
//! therefore a run that resumes: load it, ask for the next step, carry on. The
//! agent loop is the same shape for the same reason (§11.2, decision 8), and the
//! two share the runs table because they are the same problem.
//!
//! It also makes the engine testable synchronously — with no database, no
//! runtime, and **no clock**: `now` is a parameter of every method that could
//! want one, so a test that exercises a retry's backoff or a day-long `Wait`
//! moves the clock instead of sleeping.
//!
//! ## What it deliberately does not hold
//!
//! The [`Workflow`] itself. A run is *pinned* to the version it started on
//! (decision 2) and the driver loads that version from `_sc_workflow_versions`,
//! so every method that needs the program takes it as an argument. Copying the
//! steps into the run row would store the same document twice and invite the two
//! to disagree.
//!
//! Nor the JavaScript evaluator: a `Set`'s value, a `Branch`'s guard, a
//! `ForEach`'s collection and a `Wait`'s deadline are all *formulas*, and the
//! machine asks for them to be evaluated ([`Decision::Evaluate`]) rather than
//! evaluating them. That is what keeps it sans-IO, and it is why one enum covers
//! all four.
//!
//! ## Two rules worth reading before the code
//!
//! **A step failing and a workflow being wrong are different.** A step that
//! returns an error goes through the error policy — retried, handled, or fatal
//! (§2.4). A `Next` that names a step which does not exist, or a `Set` step whose
//! stored kind is not a `Set`, is the *program* being broken: validation should
//! have caught it, retrying it would never help, and a handler step written for
//! business failures is not an answer to it. Those end the run directly, naming
//! what is inconsistent.
//!
//! **The end of a `ForEach` body is the end of an iteration, not of the run.**
//! There is one flat list of steps and one frame stack, so `Next::End` inside a
//! loop means "come back for the next item" and `Next::End` outside one means
//! "the run is over". Which it is, is a question the stack answers.
