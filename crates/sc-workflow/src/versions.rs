//! `_fd_workflow_versions`: the rows a workflow's history is made of (design §9,
//! §10.3).
//!
//! **Versions are rows, and the table is append-only.** Saving an edited workflow
//! mints `version + 1`; nothing ever updates a row, and nothing deletes one while
//! its workflow exists. That is not bookkeeping for its own sake — it is what
//! makes the sentence in GOALS implementable: *a suspended run finishes on its
//! own version of the workflow*. A run records the version it started on and
//! loads that one for the rest of its life, so the workflow can be edited twice
//! while a run waits for an approval and the run still finishes as the steps it
//! started with.
//!
//! Steps in the trigger's `attributes` would have been smaller and would have
//! made that sentence unimplementable, because there would be nothing to pin to.
//!
//! Two departures from §9's "every metadata table has a `name`", both of them the
//! same departure `_fd_runs` makes: a version has no name and no description of
//! its own identity. It is addressed by `(workflow, version)`, which is what the
//! `UNIQUE` is on, and the name an admin knows it by is the **trigger's** —
//! inventing one here would be residue on every row.
//!
//! Reading is strict, as `_fd_triggers`' reader is: a version that does not parse
//! is an error naming the workflow and the version, never a workflow silently
//! read as fewer steps than it has. A run advanced on a half-read program would
//! do a subset of what the admin drew.
