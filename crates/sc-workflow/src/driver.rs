//! The driver: the one thing that does IO for a [`WorkflowRun`] (§10.3, phase 3).
//!
//! The machine decides; this drives. It loads the version the run is **pinned**
//! to, asks the machine what to do, does it — runs an action through the
//! registry, or evaluates formulas through the isolate — feeds the outcome back,
//! and **writes once**.
//!
//! ```text
//! load version ─▶ next_step ─▶ run the action / evaluate ─▶ feed back ─▶ write once
//!                    ▲                                                      │
//!                    └──────────── still the same step? ────────────────────┘
//! ```
//!
//! ## One advance is one step, and one write
//!
//! [`advance`](Driver::advance) services **one step**, not one decision: a `Set`
//! of three assignments is three trips to the evaluator and one step, and its
//! `Next` — a branch whose guards need evaluating — belongs to the step that is
//! ending rather than to the one that has not begun. So the loop inside an
//! advance continues while the machine keeps asking about the same **entry** of
//! a step, and stops the moment the work belongs to another one.
//!
//! The entry, not the name: a `ForEach` whose body is a single step asks about
//! that one name once per item, and a pass that serviced all hundred of them
//! would give the loop one write and one trace row for the lot — the durability
//! granularity of the loop rather than of the item. `steps_taken` moves on every
//! entry, so comparing it is what makes a hundred iterations a hundred advances.
//!
//! What that write contains is decision 6's guarantee: the context, the cursor,
//! the attempt count, the run's state, its `wake_at` and the step's trace row,
//! committed **together, once**, in a single transaction — **and the rows the
//! step itself wrote go in it too**. A run is therefore never observed
//! half-advanced, and never advanced past a step whose writes were lost.
//!
//! ## One step, one transaction
//!
//! The transaction is opened for the step, not for the write at the end of it: a
//! [`SharedTx`] is handed to the action through its [`ActionContext`], the row
//! layer runs every statement for a table that transaction serves inside it, and
//! the events those writes raise are dispatched **in the same transaction** — so
//! a trigger that writes an audit row for a row this step wrote commits with the
//! step or vanishes with it. Then the run's advance and its trace rows go in
//! before the single commit.
//!
//! A step that **fails** is rolled back before anything else happens: the rows it
//! wrote are undone, and only then is the failure itself recorded (the attempt
//! count, the retry deadline, the error) — in a transaction of its own, because a
//! record of the failure that rolled back with the failure would be no record at
//! all.
//!
//! It begins when the step first touches the database, so a step that calls an
//! HTTP endpoint and writes nothing holds no transaction while it waits.
//!
//! What the transaction cannot contain is what the database does not hold: an
//! HTTP request, an email, an LLM call, a write to a table on another connection
//! or one a module serves, and the runs (agent or workflow) a step starts — each
//! of those is its own unit of durability, and §10.3 records the deviation rather
//! than implying otherwise. The consequence is the honest one: a step is **at
//! least once**. A node that dies between running an action and committing comes
//! back, is told to run the same step again, and runs no other. Steps SHOULD be
//! idempotent.
//!
//! ## The clock is a parameter
//!
//! Every method that could want the time takes a [`Clock`], and the task loop is
//! the only thing that holds a real one. A retry's backoff, a day-long `Wait` and
//! an abandoned approval are all tested by moving the clock; **no test sleeps**.
