//! The [`Workflow`]: a program a trigger body can be (design §10.3).
//!
//! Pure data, and **the stored JSON is the API shape and the editor's shape**.
//! There is no second spelling: what `_sc_workflow_versions.steps` holds is what
//! `getWorkflow` answers and what the canvas round-trips, so a step the engine
//! understands and a step the editor draws cannot drift apart.
//!
//! ## Control flow is data, with one escape hatch
//!
//! v1 spells "what runs next" as a JavaScript expression over the step names.
//! That is expressive and impossible to *draw*: a visual editor cannot round-trip
//! an arbitrary expression into edges. So [`Next`] is an enum — a step, a branch
//! of guarded arms, a formula, or the end — where the first two are exactly what
//! the canvas draws and edits, and the third keeps v1's power for the case that
//! needs it (one dashed edge to a computed marker, editable as text, never
//! silently rewritten). All four lower to the one question the engine asks:
//! *given this context, which step is next?*
//!
//! ## Five step kinds, and why five
//!
//! GOALS asks for a minimal built-in set, and the count is what that decides.
//! [`StepKind::Action`] runs **any registered action**, which is how
//! `run_js_code`, `send_email`, the row actions and `run_agent` are all already
//! workflow steps; the other four are the things no action can be:
//! [`Set`](StepKind::Set) writes formulas into the run context,
//! [`ForEach`](StepKind::ForEach) is the explicit loop, [`Wait`](StepKind::Wait)
//! is a durable timer and [`UserForm`](StepKind::UserForm) suspends for a person.
//! Everything else an admin could want is an action, and adding an action is not
//! adding a step kind.
//!
//! ## Formulas
//!
//! Every formula here — a `Set` value, a `Branch` arm's guard, a `ForEach`'s
//! collection, a `Wait`'s deadline — is `sc-expr` in the scope
//! [`workflow_shape`](crate::workflow_shape) decides: what an action's
//! configuration sees, plus the ambient `context` (decision 8). They are stored
//! as **source**, not as parsed formulas, because the source is what the admin
//! typed and what the editor shows back.
