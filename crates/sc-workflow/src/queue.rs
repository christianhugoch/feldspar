//! The queue: which runs want the engine, and who is working on them (§10.3,
//! decision 5).
//!
//! The design says the engine is driven by "a durable queue on the bus", and
//! `sc-bus` does not exist. Building one to hold a queue would be building the
//! wrong thing first: **a durable queue's authority has to be the database
//! anyway**, or a crashed node loses the runs it was holding. So the runnable set
//! is a query —
//!
//! ```text
//! kind = 'workflow'
//!   AND state IN ('running', 'waiting')
//!   AND wake_at IS NOT NULL AND wake_at <= now
//!   AND (lease_until IS NULL OR lease_until < now)
//! ```
//!
//! — and claiming a run is a conditional `UPDATE` on that same predicate, which
//! is correct for two nodes as well as for one: both may read the same row, but
//! the first `UPDATE` puts a lease in the *future* and the second's `WHERE` no
//! longer matches, so it claims nothing. Nothing here needs a transaction, a lock
//! or a queue table.
//!
//! ## The seam, and what it is for
//!
//! [`WorkQueue`] is the shape `sc-bus` will implement later: "claim what is due"
//! and "**wake me when something might be**". Only the second is interesting —
//! today it is a sleep, tomorrow it is a `NOTIFY` or a Redis subscription, and
//! **nothing above the seam knows which it is talking to**. The polling
//! implementation is what ships, and it is twenty lines.
//!
//! ## The query an idle deployment does not run
//!
//! That predicate is cheap, and it was still the most expensive thing an idle
//! server did: a round trip every poll, forever, to be told nothing is due. So
//! the catalog keeps [`RunWakeups`](sc_catalog::RunWakeups) — the earliest
//! instant any live run might want the engine — and a poll that the cache says
//! is pointless **runs no query at all**. The cache is maintained by whoever
//! writes a run row (`sc_agent::note_wakeup`), refreshed by
//! [`next_wakeup`](DatabaseQueue::next_wakeup) whenever a poll finds nothing
//! due, and re-checked against the database once per
//! [`trust window`](DatabaseQueue::with_rescan) so a run another process started
//! is picked up even with no bus to hear about it.
//!
//! ```text
//! nothing at all:    poll → cache says no → 0 queries    (one scan per window)
//! a wait until 3pm:  poll → cache says no → 0 queries    (until 3pm)
//! something due:     poll → the runnable set → claim
//! ```
//!
//! ## Recovery is not a special case
//!
//! A lease that has run out is a crashed node's run, and the next poll picks it
//! up because an expired lease reads exactly like no lease at all. There is no
//! crash detector, no heartbeat table and no recovery pass — which is why
//! recovery is tested by writing a row with a stale lease rather than by killing
//! a process.
