//! Checking a [`Workflow`] before it is stored — and again before a run of it is
//! started (design §10.3, decision 11).
//!
//! One function, [`workflow_issues`], and everything that can be wrong with a
//! workflow is checked in it. It runs **on save**, because that is when the admin
//! is looking at the canvas and can fix it, and again **on load** in
//! [`start_run`](crate::start_run), because the world moves underneath a stored
//! document: a table is dropped, a plugin that provided a step's action is
//! removed, a dump is restored somewhere the formulas do not resolve.
//!
//! That is the same shape — and the same reason —
//! [`validate_trigger`](sc_action::validate_trigger) has for the other half of a
//! trigger. What is checked *there* is what both bodies share (the name, the
//! event, the channel, the role floor, the timing, the `only_if`); what is
//! checked **here** is the program, because the program lives in a version row
//! rather than on the trigger.
//!
//! ## Issues, not one error
//!
//! [`workflow_issues`] answers a **list**, each entry naming the step it is
//! about, because the caller is a visual editor: an admin who has three broken
//! steps wants three markers on three nodes, not one message about whichever the
//! checker happened to reach first. [`validate_workflow`] is the same pass
//! reduced to a `Result` for the callers that only need a yes or no — the save,
//! and the start of a run.
//!
//! A workflow that fails is **still stored, still listed and still editable**,
//! with its reason kept: editing it is the repair, and a document that vanished
//! from the screen when it stopped validating would be a document nobody can fix.
//! What it cannot do is start a run.
//!
//! ## Reachability, and the one thing that suspends it
//!
//! Every step should be reachable from the start, because a step nothing points
//! at is either a mistake or a leftover, and both are worth saying. The exception
//! is [`Next::Formula`]: which step a computed `next` reaches is a question only
//! the run can answer (that is why it is drawn as one dashed edge to a marker
//! rather than as edges), so a workflow that contains a reachable one has **no**
//! decidable unreachable set, and this check stands down rather than inventing
//! one.
