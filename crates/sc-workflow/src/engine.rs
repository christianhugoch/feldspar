//! [`WorkflowEngineTask`]: the process's workflow engine — the
//! [`WorkflowEngine`] seam filled in, and the one tokio task that advances runs
//! nobody is waiting for (§10.3, phase 3.3).
//!
//! Two jobs, and they are the same machinery pointed at two moments:
//!
//! - **Starting a run.** A trigger whose body is a workflow fires — from an
//!   event, from the admin's Run button, from the scheduler, or from an
//!   application's exposed endpoint, all four of which come through
//!   [`fire_trigger`](sc_action::fire_trigger) — and the engine creates a run
//!   pinned to the workflow's current version and drives it as far as it goes
//!   right now. What the caller gets is the run's **id and state**, not a result:
//!   a workflow may suspend for a day, so what is returned is something
//!   addressable rather than a wait (§10.2).
//! - **Advancing runs whose time has come.** A retry's backoff, a `Wait`'s end, a
//!   resumed approval, and a run a crashed node was holding. Those have no caller
//!   at all, which is what the task and the [queue](crate::queue) are for.
//!
//! ## Started only by `serve`
//!
//! For the reason the scheduler is (§10.2): a `build-app`, a backup or an admin
//! script must not start advancing workflow runs because it happened to open the
//! same database. A process with no engine runs every action trigger normally and
//! tells the caller, of a workflow, that nothing here can run one.
//!
//! ## Shutdown lets the step finish
//!
//! [`stop`](WorkflowEngineTask::stop) asks the loop to end; a tick already in
//! flight finishes its steps and writes them, because a step abandoned between
//! its effect and its write is the one case at-least-once turns into "twice" for
//! no reason.
