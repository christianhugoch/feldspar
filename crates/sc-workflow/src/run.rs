//! The **workflow half of an `_sc_runs` row** (§10.3, §11.4): what a run of a
//! workflow carries beyond what an agent run does, and how the machine's state
//! gets in and out of it.
//!
//! The table is `sc-agent`'s, and deliberately so — a chat session and a durable
//! workflow run are the same problem (a context written after every step and read
//! back to carry on), and giving them two tables would mean writing the resume
//! path twice. What is here is only the part that is a *workflow's*:
//!
//! - the [`WorkflowRun`] machine state, in `context`;
//! - the trigger's **id**, so the pinned version can be found ([`ATTR_WORKFLOW`]);
//! - the **event** that started the run, whole ([`ATTR_EVENT`]), so a run resumed
//!   the next day still reads `row.total` as the row that started it;
//! - the **chain** of triggers that led here ([`ATTR_CHAIN`]), so a step's writes
//!   are bounded by `MAX_DEPTH` exactly as an action's are.
//!
//! ## Why the event is stored rather than rebuilt
//!
//! Because there is nothing to rebuild it from. The row that fired the trigger
//! may have been deleted, updated twice, or never existed (a `login` event's user
//! is not a row of anything). A suspended run that woke up and re-read the world
//! would be a run whose formulas mean something different from what they meant
//! when it started, which is the same mistake as un-pinning its version.
//!
//! [`Event`] is not `Serialize` — it is a live value passed down a call stack —
//! so [`StoredEvent`] is its JSON shape, and the round trip is tested.
