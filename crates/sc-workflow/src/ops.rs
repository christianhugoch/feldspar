//! The four things somebody does **to** a run that the run does not do to
//! itself (§10.3, phase 4): answer its form, cancel it, retry it, and list the
//! runs of one workflow.
//!
//! Everything else the engine does is driven by the [queue](crate::queue): a
//! retry's backoff comes round, a `Wait` ends, a crashed node's lease expires.
//! These four have a person behind them, and that is the whole reason they are a
//! module rather than more of the driver.
//!
//! ## Resuming drives, it does not merely enqueue
//!
//! [`resume_run`] writes the answers, claims the run under a lease and then
//! **drives it** to wherever it gets to next, exactly as
//! [`start_run`](crate::start_run) drives a run it has just created. The
//! alternative — write the row and let the poll pick it up — would mean an admin
//! who clicks *Approve* is told "running" and has to reload to find out what
//! happened, which is not what pressing the button meant.
//!
//! Holding the lease across the drive matters as much as the drive: without it
//! the engine task on this node (or another) could claim the same row a
//! millisecond later, and the step would run twice for no reason at all.
//!
//! ## Who may answer a form
//!
//! The form's own `min_role`, defaulting to **admin** — the same floor, the same
//! default and the same reading a trigger's own exposure has
//! (`role <= min_role`, and `None` means role 1). [`check_may_resume`] is the
//! one place that rule is written; the API layer calls it, because *who is
//! asking* is a question about a request and not about a run.
