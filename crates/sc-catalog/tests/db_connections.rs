//! Integration test for **database connections**: a second, foreign Postgres
//! database whose tables share the catalog with the primary's.
//!
//! Two real databases, because that is the only way to test this. The whole
//! feature is a claim about what happens when introspection has two sources —
//! that the foreign tables arrive, that they are stamped with the connection
//! rather than with `primary`, that a query against one reaches *that* database
//! and not the one Saltcorn's own tables are in, and that a name Saltcorn
//! already uses is not quietly taken over. None of those survives a mock.
//!
//! The story in order:
//!
//! 1. **stored and connected** — a connection is saved as a row, connected, and
//!    its tables appear in the catalog beside the primary's.
//! 2. **rows come from the right database** — the same table name exists in both
//!    with different rows, and the primary keeps the name while the foreign one
//!    is reported as shadowed.
//! 3. **schema changes are refused** — Saltcorn reads and writes a foreign
//!    table's rows and does not restructure it.
//! 4. **disconnecting** — deleting the connection takes its tables back out.
//! 5. **the password never comes back out** — what a `dial` needs is stored, and
//!    what is stored round-trips.
