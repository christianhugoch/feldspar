//! The `_sc_file_stores` table: its schema, bootstrap, and the
//! [`FileStoreDef`] ⇄ row mapping (design §9, §14.1).
//!
//! A file store, like an application (§13.2), has **nothing to introspect it
//! from**: `information_schema` knows about tables, not about which directories
//! an admin has connected. So — by the same §9 argument that gives
//! `_sc_applications` its existence — a store's row *is* the store's definition,
//! and this is the second stored-metadata table Saltcorn needs. It is not an
//! overlay: without the row there is no store at all.
//!
//! This module lives in `sc-catalog` rather than `sc-files`, where
//! [`FileStoreDef`] does, for a reason that is not negotiable: persistence needs
//! a [`Catalog`], and `sc-files` cannot have one, because `sc-catalog` already
//! depends on `sc-files`. `sc-catalog` is the lowest crate holding both the
//! `FileStore` trait and a `Catalog`, and it already owns the connected-store
//! registry ([`Catalog::connect_file_store`]), so definition and instance stay
//! within one crate of each other.
//!
//! **Reading is strict**, exactly as it is for applications: a column that is
//! missing or of the wrong shape is an [`Error::invalid`] naming the store and
//! the column, not a silently defaulted field. A half-understood row is a
//! misconfigured store the admin needs told about.
//!
//! **Deleting a definition never touches the bytes.** See
//! [`delete_file_store`].
