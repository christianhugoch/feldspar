//! The `_sc_tables` overlay: its schema, bootstrap, and the [`TableMeta`] ⇄ row
//! mapping (design §9).
//!
//! This is the first **overlay** table Saltcorn stores, and that word carries a
//! rule the other `_sc_*` tables do not have to keep. A file store or an
//! application *is* its row — delete the row and the object is gone (§13.2,
//! §14.1). A table is not: it exists in the database whether or not this table
//! has a row for it, and it must stay exactly as usable with no row as it is
//! today. So everything here **adds** to what introspection already yields —
//! access rules, a label, a description, sparse attributes — and nothing here
//! may restate a fact the database already knows. That is not a stylistic
//! preference: it is what keeps §9's "legacy databases just work" true, and it
//! is why a column like `nullable` must never appear in this table.
//!
//! The merge — where a stored row becomes part of the [`Table`] the rest of the
//! system sees — is [`Table::apply_overlay`], applied by
//! [`Catalog::reload`](crate::Catalog::reload); the precedence rule is stated
//! there. This module is the storage under it.
//!
//! The shape follows the `_sc_file_stores` module column for column:
//! one column per value every row has, sparse values in `attributes`, and
//! **strict reads** — a missing or ill-typed column is an [`Error::invalid`]
//! naming the table and the column, never a silent default. Strictness matters
//! more here than it does for a store, because the values being read decide who
//! may read and write rows: a `min_role_read` that fails to parse must not
//! degrade to *some* role.
//!
//! Two deliberate differences from `_sc_file_stores`, both about the same thing:
//!
//! - **The access columns are `NOT NULL`.** A store's `min_role` is nullable
//!   because "no floor" is a real state for it. A table's rules are always a
//!   pair of roles — a row that exists says who may read and who may write, and
//!   a NULL there would be a third state ("inherit from what?") that has no
//!   answer.
//! - **A system (`_sc_*`) table may not have a row.** System tables are hidden
//!   from users (§9) and their access is not the admin's to widen; the check is
//!   here, on save, rather than only in the merge, so the state never exists.
//!
//! ## The one exception: a **provided** table's row is not an overlay
//!
//! `_sc_tables` holds two kinds of row, and the paragraphs above are about the
//! first. A row carrying a [`ProvidedTableDef`] — a module, a provider within
//! it, and that provider's configuration — is a **definition**: the table it
//! names exists *because the row does*, there is nothing in the database to
//! introspect, and deleting the row deletes the table. That is the same
//! relationship `_sc_triggers` has to a trigger, in a table whose other rows
//! have the opposite one.
//!
//! It is stated here rather than left implicit because the rule above ("nothing
//! here may restate a fact the database already knows") is what keeps §9's
//! "legacy databases just work" true, and a reader has to be able to see that
//! this does not weaken it: a provided table is not a database table, so there
//! is no fact of the database for its row to contradict. The design anticipated
//! it — §9's `_sc_tables` line reads "access rules, label/description,
//! attributes, **provided-table defs**".
