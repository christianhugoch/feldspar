//! Postgres row-level security for ownership formulas (§7.3, TODO Phase 6).
//!
//! When a table has `rls_enabled`, the *same* ownership formula the runtime
//! path (§5) evaluates is enforced by the database instead: generated RLS
//! policies decide every row, and the application's own checks are switched off
//! (GOALS: "then you no longer have to check"). Two halves live here:
//!
//! - **Caller context** ([`CallerContext`], [`run_in_context`]): every row
//!   operation on an RLS table runs inside a transaction that first `SET LOCAL`s
//!   the caller's role and identity as GUCs. The policies read them with
//!   `current_setting(name, true)`; a transaction that forgets to set them sees
//!   `NULL`, which every policy treats as "no access", so a forgotten context
//!   **fails closed** — the property is a shape of the policy, not a hope.
//! - **Policy generation** ([`enable_rls`], [`disable_rls`]): the formula's
//!   `sc_query::Expr` (translated with [`UserEnv::Guc`]) rendered — literals
//!   inlined, because `CREATE POLICY` is DDL and takes no binds — into four
//!   per-operation policies, atop `ENABLE`/`FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`.
