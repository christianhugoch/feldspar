//! [`TableProvider`]: presenting a data source as a queryable table.
//!
//! A provider interprets the universal query language ([`Select`], plus
//! [`Statement`] writes) and returns rows (technical design §8.3). There are two
//! implementations:
//!
//! - [`DriverTableProvider`] — the trivial one, which forwards straight to the
//!   [`DatabaseDriver`]. Every database table is served by one.
//! - [`ProvidedTableProvider`] — a table whose rows come from a **module's**
//!   table provider: `@saltcorn/rss`'s `RSS feed`, `@saltcorn/proxmox`'s cluster
//!   listings. The module answers a list of JSON objects and
//!   [`inmem`](crate::inmem) applies the `Select` to them.
//!
//! Materialisation (`None | Snapshot | Synced`) remains deferred, so the trait
//! carries only the read/write surface.
//!
//! ## The seam
//!
//! `sc-catalog` is layer 4 and a module host is layer 6, so the dependency is
//! inverted exactly as `sc-expr`'s `ModuleFnHost` is: [`TableProviderHost`] is
//! declared here, implemented in `sc-module`, and installed on the
//! [`Catalog`](crate::Catalog) by `sc-server` at boot and after every module
//! change. A process with no modules has none, and a provided table there is a
//! table with no fields and a reason — never a panic and never a silently empty
//! one.
