//! [`Table`]: a table as the catalog presents it.
//!
//! A `Table` is pure data — its id, name, database, fields, primary key, access
//! rules, and attributes — built either from introspection
//! ([`Table::from_physical`]) or from a create request. The *behaviour* of
//! serving rows lives in a [`TableProvider`](crate::TableProvider), which the
//! [`Catalog`](crate::Catalog) constructs on demand; [`TableSource`] records
//! which kind of provider backs the table so that identity stays serialisable
//! and comparable (technical design §8.2).
