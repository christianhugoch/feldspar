//! Fields and the identifiers that tie them together.
//!
//! The technical design (§6.2) separates a **database** field ([`DataField`] —
//! a column in a table) from a [**form** field](sc_types::FormField), and shares
//! their common shape in [`BaseField`]. The MVP models `DataField` fully —
//! including the `Key` and `File` kinds, even though the admin UI only exercises
//! `Plain` — so the data model is right from the start (calculated fields are
//! post-MVP; see the crate root).
//!
//! Only `DataField` and the identifiers live here. `BaseField` and `FormField`
//! are in `sc-types` beside [`Attrs`], which they carry and describe. What keeps
//! `DataField` up here is its [`Key`](DataFieldKind::Key)/[`File`](DataFieldKind::File)
//! kinds, which reference catalog identifiers, and its `Column`/`ColumnDef`
//! bridge — none of which `BaseField` ever needed. All three are re-exported
//! from this crate, so a caller reaching for `sc_catalog::BaseField` still finds
//! it.
