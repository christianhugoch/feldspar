//! Table constraints: jointly-unique keys, indexes, full-text indexes and row
//! constraints (design §5, §9; TODO Phase 2).
//!
//! ## They live in the database
//!
//! Everything else Saltcorn stores about a table is an *overlay* — a row in
//! `_sc_tables` adding what introspection cannot yield, under §9's rule that
//! nothing there may restate a fact the database already knows. A constraint is
//! such a fact. So there is no `_sc_constraints` table: a constraint is created
//! as the database object it *is*, read back by
//! [`introspect`](sc_db::DatabaseDriver::introspect) like the primary key and
//! the foreign keys, and presented here as a [`TableConstraint`]. Three
//! consequences, all of them the point:
//!
//! - a `UNIQUE` somebody added in `psql` shows up wherever Saltcorn's do,
//! - `pg_dump`/restore carries constraints without a metadata table to restore
//!   beside them,
//! - and there is no second copy to disagree with the first.
//!
//! ## What the database cannot hold, the comment holds
//!
//! Two things are Saltcorn's rather than Postgres's: the **error message** an
//! admin writes for a violated constraint, and the **formula** a row constraint
//! was generated from — a `plpgsql` body is not a formula, and re-deriving one
//! from the other is not a thing anybody should attempt. Both ride in the
//! object's comment as one JSON object under the [`META_KEY`] key
//! ([`ConstraintMeta`]). A comment is the natural home rather than a hiding
//! place: it is attached to the object, dropped with it, and carried by a dump.
//! A comment that is absent, is prose, or is JSON without our key leaves a
//! constraint that still works and is still listed — with no message and, for a
//! trigger, not recognised as a row constraint at all (see
//! [`TableConstraint::from_physical`]).
//!
//! ## A row constraint is a trigger
//!
//! GOALS requires constraint formulae to use join fields and aggregations, and a
//! `CHECK` constraint may not query another table — so a row constraint is one
//! `CONSTRAINT TRIGGER` over a `plpgsql` function that evaluates the *same*
//! `sc_query::Expr` the ownership translator produces, and raises the admin's
//! message. It is `DEFERRABLE INITIALLY IMMEDIATE` for the reason the foreign
//! keys already carry it (§13.1) — unchanged at the statement, deferrable to
//! commit by a caller holding the transaction, which is what lets rows that
//! point at each other arrive in a file's order — and it is `AFTER` because
//! that is what a deferrable trigger is.
