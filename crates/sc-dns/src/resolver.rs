//! The resolver the wrapper asks: one thread, one current-thread runtime, one
//! [`hickory_resolver`] client.
//!
//! **Why a thread of its own.** `getaddrinfo` is a blocking C function called
//! from anywhere: a tokio worker, tokio's blocking pool, `async-net`'s blocking
//! pool, a V8 thread, a thread this process never created. A resolver that is
//! `async` cannot be driven from any of those without a runtime handle, and
//! `block_on` inside a runtime worker panics. So the runtime is *here*, on a
//! thread this crate owns, and the outside world talks to it over a channel and
//! waits on the reply. One thread, parked on a channel receive, is the whole
//! cost.
//!
//! **Why it never fails the process.** A boot that cannot read
//! `/etc/resolv.conf` still serves: the fallback is the same one glibc makes
//! (`127.0.0.1`), and a name that then does not resolve fails one request rather
//! than the server. What *is* worth saying out loud is the fallback itself, so
//! it goes to stderr where the journal reads it.
