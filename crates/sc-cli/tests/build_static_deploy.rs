//! `scripts/build-static.sh --deploy HOST`: the copy-unpack-install step that
//! runs after the tarball is written.
//!
//! The build itself is not what is under test here — compiling V8 to check a
//! `scp` would be absurd — so this drives the script inside a throwaway
//! "repository" (the script, and the `Cargo.toml` it reads the version from)
//! with a `PATH` in front of it holding stubs for the commands the deploy path
//! cannot really run: `cargo` (writes a one-line executable where the build would
//! have left the binary), `rustup`, `ssh`, `sudo` — and `systemctl`, which the
//! deploy asks whether the service is running and which a test must never reach
//! for real.
//!
//! The `ssh` stub is what makes this a real test rather than a spelling check:
//! it runs the command it was handed **locally**, so the remote half of the
//! deploy — the unpack, `install.sh`, the smoke run of the installed binary, the
//! cleanup — actually executes, against a `--prefix` and a `--remote-tmp` inside
//! the test's temporary directory. What the assertions then look at is the
//! installed tree, not the script's text.
