//! Translating a declared settings spec (decision D5).
//!
//! **The server translates everything the server says.** An admin's browser
//! shows two kinds of English: literals in `ui/admin/src/*.tsx`, and text that
//! *arrived from the server* — a `FormField` label out of a stream provider's
//! `config_spec`, a settings section heading, a framework's one-sentence
//! description. The second kind is translated here, against the request's
//! negotiated locale, before it is serialised. The SPA's own catalogue covers
//! the SPA's own literals and nothing else.
//!
//! The alternative — ship the `core` catalogue to the browser and translate
//! there — fails on the first message carrying a value computed server-side, and
//! makes every other client of the API (the MCP server, the `feldspar` CLI, a
//! generated app client) responsible for a job the server already has the locale
//! for.
//!
//! # Why this lives in `sc-types` and not in `sc-i18n`
//!
//! `sc-i18n` is layer 0 so that `sc-types` and `sc-auth` can call `t!`. A
//! function that walks a [`FormField`] therefore cannot live there — the
//! dependency would be a cycle. It lives with the type it walks, which is also
//! where a new field of that type would be noticed.
//!
//! # What is translated, and what is not
//!
//! The **label**, and nothing else. In particular:
//!
//! - A field's **name** is an identifier — it is the key in an [`Attrs`] bag and
//!   the thing a save is validated against — so translating it would rename the
//!   setting.
//! - **Options** are *values*, not labels: `FormField::options(["vite",
//!   "webpack"])` restricts what may be stored, and a translated `"vite"` is a
//!   value that fails its own validation. When options grow labels distinct from
//!   their values, this is where they get translated.
//! - **Help text** is not on `FormField` at all; it hangs off `sc_config`'s
//!   `ConfigDef`, which translates it where it serialises it.
//!
//! [`Attrs`]: crate::Attrs
