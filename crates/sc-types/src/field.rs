//! [`BaseField`] and [`FormField`]: the shape of a field, and a field in a form
//! (design §6.2).
//!
//! GOALS calls out that v1 conflated database fields and form fields, so v2
//! separates them: [`BaseField`] is what they share (name, label, type,
//! type-specific attributes), `DataField` (in `sc-catalog`, because its `Key`
//! kind references catalog identifiers) adds the column constraints, and
//! [`FormField`] adds what it takes to render and validate an input control.
//!
//! **A [`FormField`] is also how every configurable extension point declares its
//! settings.** A `Framework` (§13.3), `Action` (§10.1), `Agent` (§11.1),
//! `ModelProvider` (§14.2), `FieldView` (§6.3) and a `RichType`'s attributes
//! (§6.1) all answer the same question — *what should the admin be asked?* — and
//! all answer it with `Vec<FormField>`. That is the whole point of declaring
//! settings as data: the admin UI renders a form for whichever extension the
//! admin picked without a per-extension special case, and an extension supplied
//! by a guest language through `sc-code` is configured the same way as a built-in
//! one. §6.2 already says a form field "may derive from a `DataField` **or be
//! standalone**" — a setting is exactly the standalone case, so it needs no type
//! of its own.
//!
//! The values a `FormField` describes live in an [`Attrs`] bag, are stored in a
//! JSON column, and reach the admin UI as JSON, so [`default`](FormField::default)
//! and [`options`](FormField::options) are [`serde_json::Value`]s — the same
//! thing that ends up in the bag, not [`Value`](sc_query::Value)'s tagged
//! encoding.
