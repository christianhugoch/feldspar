//! The administrative tool surface: one implementation, two callers (§13.6).
//!
//! These are the tools that build an application's **configuration half** — the
//! tables and their fields, the access rules of §7.3, the triggers over them and
//! the custom SQL queries an application serves. They were written for the
//! built-in `admin_copilot` agent and they live here because they have a second
//! caller: the **administration MCP server**, which projects the same tools to
//! an external coding agent over HTTP.
//!
//! Two callers, one implementation. The alternative — a copy of `edit_schema`
//! for the chat copilot and another for MCP — is the failure
//! [`crate::schema_edit`]'s module comment was written to prevent,
//! moved up one level: two bodies that check grants slightly differently and
//! drift within a release. So the bodies live at the lowest layer that can hold
//! them, and the copilot — `sc-core-traits`'s `admin_copilot` — and the MCP
//! server are both thin things over a [`ToolSet`].
//!
//! ## What a caller supplies, and what it does not
//!
//! A [`ToolSet`] is parameterised by **grants** and **areas** — never by *who*
//! the caller is. The copilot passes an agent's configuration checkboxes and the
//! MCP server passes a token's; neither knows the other exists, and the six
//! flags mean the same thing in both because they *are* the same six flags
//! ([`Grants`] plus [`Areas`]).
//!
//! Who the caller is arrives per call, on a [`ToolContext`]: the catalog to work
//! in, the role the call is authorized at, the user it runs as where there is
//! one, and the trigger dispatcher where the process has one. Every tool here
//! refuses a caller below role 1, because a schema has no ownership formula to
//! fall back on and the admin API guards every catalog endpoint with `admin()`.
//!
//! ## Grants refuse, areas disappear
//!
//! A **grant** — create, edit, drop, access changes — is checked when the tool
//! runs and refused in words the model can relay, naming the checkbox that would
//! allow it. The tool stays *visible*, because a model that may not drop a table
//! still has to be able to say that dropping one is what the admin asked for.
//!
//! An **area** — the triggers half, the applications half — is a statement that
//! this whole part of the job is not this caller's, so its tools are taken out
//! of the listing entirely. A tool the model can see is a tool it will try, and
//! a turn spent discovering what a caller is not for is a turn somebody pays
//! for. [`ToolSet::call`] still refuses a switched-off area by name, because
//! `call` is an entry point that takes a string and a switched-off area must mean
//! the same thing however the string arrived.
//!
//! ## Why the set is a list of [`AdminTool`]s
//!
//! Seven of the ten tools are implemented here; the three that reach an
//! `Application` cannot be, because `sc-app` is layer 8 *above* this crate and
//! the storage they read lives there. So a tool is a
//! trait object and a set is a list of them, which is also what phase 4's
//! generated tools want: a tool projected from a tagged [`Endpoint`](crate::Endpoint)
//! dispatches through the handler registry, which only the server holds.
//!
//! The full ten-tool set is therefore assembled by `sc_app::mcp::tool_set`, the
//! lowest layer that can name every tool in it.
