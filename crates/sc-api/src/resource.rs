//! The **resource model**: what a table looks like to a generated consumer
//! (design §13.1).
//!
//! An [`Endpoint`](crate::Endpoint) says how a request is made and what its body
//! is *shaped* like; it deliberately says nothing about the table behind it,
//! because most endpoints have none. A table-backed API has four endpoints per
//! table which are only meaningful together — list, create, update, delete are
//! one *thing* with four verbs, over rows whose columns are known — and a client
//! generated from the endpoints alone can only type those rows as `unknown`.
//!
//! A [`ResourceModel`] is that missing half, carried in the
//! [`EndpointSet`](crate::EndpointSet) beside the endpoints and serialized with
//! them: the table's columns and their wire types, which of them a write may
//! set, which are keys into another resource (so an embedded `?select=` can be
//! typed), and the names of the endpoints each operation is performed by. The
//! TypeScript generator turns one resource into one row interface and one client
//! object with methods, rather than four loose methods with `unknown` in their
//! signatures.
//!
//! Nothing here restates what an endpoint already knows: the model *names* its
//! endpoints rather than copying their paths or auth, so the two cannot drift —
//! an operation whose endpoint the projection did not register (a keyless table
//! has no `update`) is simply absent.
