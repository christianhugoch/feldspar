//! Files in a code body: the host behind `fs` (§10.1, the addendum "Files in a
//! code body").
//!
//! `sc-expr` runs the JavaScript and knows nothing about stores — its
//! [`FileHost`] seam is one JSON operation in, one JSON value out, which is what
//! makes it the seam §15's other guest languages implement rather than a
//! JavaScript feature. [`FileStoreHost`] is the implementation of that seam for
//! *this* server's stores, and it lives here for the reason [`TableHost`] does:
//! everything it needs is already at this layer — the catalog that resolves a
//! store name to a connected [`FileStore`], the store definitions that carry the
//! store-wide access floor, and `sc-files`'s path-cumulative rule.
//!
//! [`TableHost`]: super::TableHost
//!
//! # What crosses
//!
//! One operation per method the guest calls on a file — `await file.text()` is
//! one round trip — as a flat JSON object naming the store, the path, whose
//! authority it runs under, and whatever the operation itself needs:
//!
//! ```json
//! { "op": "read", "store": "uploads", "path": "notes/a.txt",
//!   "authority": "admin", "encoding": "text" }
//! ```
//!
//! **Nothing in it is trusted.** The store is resolved through the catalog, the
//! path is re-checked for the traversal the guest already refused, the authority
//! decides the role every check runs at, and an unknown operation or an unknown
//! field is refused naming it rather than ignored.
//!
//! # Authority
//!
//! The **admin's** by default, exactly as `db`'s is and for the same reason: a
//! trigger is server-side configuration, and a file an ordinary caller may not
//! read is the archetype of what a trigger exists to write. `fs(…).asUser()`
//! delegates to the event's caller, and then §14.1's path-cumulative `min_role`
//! rule decides every operation — the store's floor, then every directory on the
//! path, then the entry itself, most restrictive wins.
//!
//! Two consequences worth stating, because they are decisions rather than
//! consequences of the code:
//!
//! - under **admin** authority no rule is consulted at all. Not a shortcut taken
//!   for speed — `ROLE_ADMIN` clears every rule that can be written, so
//!   consulting them would be reading metadata up the whole path to reach a
//!   foregone conclusion — but it does mean the store floor is not read from the
//!   database on the common path either.
//! - a **delegated** `setMeta` may tighten a rule and never loosen one. A caller
//!   who can reach a file can already read it; letting them publish it to
//!   everyone would make a non-admin the author of an access rule, which is not
//!   what delegating a trigger to its caller was meant to grant.
//!
//! # Bounds
//!
//! The **operation budget** is the runtime's ([`DEFAULT_MAX_FILE_OPS`]), since
//! only it can count what the guest does. What is here is what only this side
//! knows: how many bytes may cross the seam ([`MAX_FILE_BYTES`]) and how many
//! may be copied *without* crossing it ([`MAX_COPY_BYTES`]). A read past the cap
//! is **refused rather than truncated**, because a body handed the first 8 MB of
//! a larger file would go on to compute a wrong answer out of a right-looking
//! one — the same rule the row cap follows.
//!
