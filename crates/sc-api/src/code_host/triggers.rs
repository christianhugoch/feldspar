//! Other triggers in a code body: the host behind `trigger` (§10.2).
//!
//! `sc-expr` runs the JavaScript and knows nothing about triggers — its
//! [`TriggerHost`] seam is one JSON request in, one JSON value out, the shape
//! §15's other guest languages implement. [`TriggerRunHost`] is the
//! implementation of that seam for *this* server, and it lives here for
//! [`TableHost`](super::TableHost)'s reason: everything it needs is already at
//! this layer — the catalog, and the one
//! [`TriggerDispatcher`](sc_action::TriggerDispatcher) every other event fires
//! on.
//!
//! # It runs the dispatcher's trigger, not a copy of it
//!
//! The whole of the design, and the same sentence the agent's `run_trigger`
//! trait is built on: the call goes through the dispatcher, so the target's
//! `only_if` runs, a disabled trigger stays disabled, a trigger that failed
//! validation says why, and the **cascade bound** counts this run — a code body
//! is one more thing that can ask, not a second way to fire.
//!
//! That bound is what makes the recursion safe rather than merely bounded in
//! practice. The event this host builds carries the chain the body's own trigger
//! was handed, so `Event::firing` refuses past `MAX_DEPTH` and names the whole
//! chain: a body that runs the trigger it is itself the action of stops at the
//! fifth turn with a sentence an admin can read, not a stack overflow.
//!
//! # Authority
//!
//! `db`'s rule, for `db`'s reason. A trigger is server-side configuration, so
//! running one from another is configuration calling configuration: the default
//! is the **admin's** authority, under which the target's `min_role` is not
//! consulted at all. `asUser()` says "on behalf of whoever caused this event"
//! instead, and then the target's own floor decides — the check the agent trait
//! makes, in the same words, because exposing one trigger must not thereby
//! expose every trigger it can reach.
//!
//! What does **not** depend on the authority is who the child event says caused
//! it: the event's role and user travel either way, so the trigger that runs
//! sees the same `user` it would have seen had that caller run it directly, and
//! its own `db.asUser()` means the same person. Causation is a fact; authority
//! is a decision.
//!
//! # Bounds
//!
//! The width — how many triggers one body may run — is counted here as well as
//! in the guest, because a bound the guest could edit is not a bound. The
//! clock is the parent's: `timeout_ms` arrives filled in with what was left of
//! the body's wall clock, and the run is abandoned at it, so a slow child fails
//! inside the body that started it rather than holding the request that fired
//! the outermost trigger.
