//! The **schema snapshot**: this server's tables, in v1's vocabulary, as one
//! serialised value a guest holds before its run starts (TODO "the v1 `Table`
//! API" §2).
//!
//! # Why it exists
//!
//! v1's `Table.findOne` is synchronous. Eight years of plugins are written
//!
//! ```js
//! const table = Table.findOne("books");   // not awaited
//! const pk = table.pk_name;               // not awaited
//! for (const f of table.fields) { … }     // not awaited
//! ```
//!
//! and a host round trip cannot answer that — a `Table` that answered a promise
//! would break every line after it. So the division is v1's own: **metadata is
//! local and synchronous, data is a host call and asynchronous**, and this is
//! the local half. Every table this catalog has, with the property names v1's
//! `Table` and `Field` carry, built once and handed to the isolate before
//! anything runs.
//!
//! # It is a read of the catalog, not a second source of truth
//!
//! Everything here comes off the same [`Catalog`] a [`Plan`](super::Plan) is
//! resolved against, so a guest's `books.getField("author").is_fkey` and the
//! server's own answer to "is `author` a key" cannot disagree — one of them is
//! computed from the other. It goes stale exactly when the catalog reloads,
//! which bumps [`Catalog::generation`], which is what a run carries instead of
//! the snapshot itself.
//!
//! # What is translated, and what is not
//!
//! v1 spells some of this differently and some of it it does not have at all.
//! The translations are named where they are made:
//!
//! - A field's **id is its name**, because this server's fields are identified
//!   by name (§9), and so is a table's. A plugin keying a map by `f.id` gets a
//!   stable key either way.
//! - v1's `type` is a *type object* for a plain field and a **string** for a key
//!   (`"Key to books"`) or a file (`"File"`); `typename` is the string form of
//!   whichever it is. Both are carried, because v1 code reads both.
//! - v1's ownership is a **field** (`ownership_field_id`); here it is a formula
//!   (§7.3). Both are carried: the formula's source always, and the field only
//!   when the formula says exactly what v1's field says — `owner === user.id`
//!   and nothing else. A formula this server can evaluate and v1 could not
//!   express is not reduced to a field that would mean something narrower.
//! - `fieldview` and `sublabel` are `_sc_fields` columns in v1 and attributes
//!   here, so they are read out of the attribute bag and are null where nobody
//!   set them.
//! - `stored` is always false: this server has no stored calculated fields
//!   (§6.2 recomputes its own), and a `calculated` field here is v1's
//!   non-stored kind exactly.
//!
//! Nothing about *changing* a table is in here, because nothing in this
//! milestone can: `Table.create`, `Field.update` and every DDL method stay
//! stubs that throw naming themselves.
