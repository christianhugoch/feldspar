//! The reified endpoint model (design §13.1).
//!
//! Endpoints are Rust **values**, not just handler functions: an [`Endpoint`]
//! records its HTTP method, its path (literal segments plus typed parameters),
//! a [`TypeSchema`] for the request body and the response value, an
//! [`AuthRequirement`], and a [`HandlerRef`] naming the code that runs it. This
//! is what lets a route be fully described (and typed for consumers) even when
//! it is registered at runtime and is not known at compile time.
//!
//! An [`EndpointSet`] is the runtime registry those values live in. The admin
//! API (see [`crate::admin`]) is a fixed set of `Endpoint` constants registered
//! through this **same** machinery, so the admin SPA consumes a generated typed
//! client exactly as an application would.
