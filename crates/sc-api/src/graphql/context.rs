//! What a GraphQL resolver knows that the schema does not.
//!
//! The schema is built once, at mount, from the application's tables. Everything
//! else a resolver needs — the catalog to ask, who is asking, the evaluator an
//! untranslatable ownership formula runs on, the cap a list is bounded by —
//! arrives with the *request*, and `async-graphql`'s resolvers are `'static`
//! closures, so it arrives as request [`Data`](async_graphql::Data) rather than
//! as a captured reference.
//!
//! That is the whole reason [`ApiProvider::handle`](crate::ApiProvider::handle)
//! takes the catalog as the `Arc` the server already holds: a provider that only
//! reads it borrows and pays nothing, and this one clones it into one
//! [`RequestContext`] per request.
//!
//! Nothing here decides access. The context carries the caller; the *rule* is
//! [`ownership`](crate::ownership)'s, and this provider reaches it through the
//! same entry points every other reader does.
