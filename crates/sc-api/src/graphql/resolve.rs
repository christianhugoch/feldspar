//! Reading rows: what the root fields and the row objects actually do.
//!
//! Every resolver here is a closure built at mount time over two `String`s — the
//! table and, for a row field, the column — and everything else arrives with the
//! request ([`RequestContext`]). That is what makes the schema *data*: a
//! resolver knows the name of the thing it reads, and looks the thing itself up
//! in the live catalog each time.
//!
//! **Not a second data path.** A root list is
//! [`ownership::read_row_values_as`] — the same entry point the agent's
//! `query_table` uses, the same "meets the floor OR the formula grants it", the
//! same RLS routing. `_by_pk` is that query with a primary-key equality ANDed
//! in. Nothing here decides who may read what.
//!
//! **An outgoing key is projected, not fetched.** A requested `manager { email }`
//! does not become a second query: the resolver reads the selection set, asks
//! [`sc_expr::join_path_expr`] for the Ⱶ-join's correlated subquery, and projects
//! it as another column of the *same* `SELECT`, aliased by the join path itself
//! (`managerⱵemail`). The `manager` resolver then hands its children that row
//! with the prefix stripped, so a second hop (`managerⱵbossⱵname`) composes by
//! doing the same thing again. Only the requested leaves are projected — asking
//! for one column of a related row must not cost the whole row.
//!
//! A null key is `null`, not an error: the FK column itself rides back with the
//! row, and a null there ends the walk before any leaf is looked at. That is the
//! Ⱶ operator's own contract and it is what a GraphQL caller expects of a
//! nullable object field.
//!
//! **An incoming key is batched, not walked.** A child list cannot be projected
//! — it is many rows, not one value — so it is the one thing here that costs a
//! second statement. It costs exactly one: [`child_list_field`] says only which
//! rows this parent wants, and [`ChildLoader`](super::loader::ChildLoader)
//! answers every sibling that asked the same thing together.
//!
//! **An incoming key *aggregated* is one value again**, so it goes back to
//! being projected: `employees_aggregate(where: …) { count }` is a correlated
//! subquery in the same `SELECT` as the parent row, and
//! [`child_aggregate_field`] issues no query at all — it reads the column the
//! parent's read already computed. The root `X_aggregate` has no parent to ride
//! with and runs one statement of its own. Either way the *rows* being counted
//! are the ones the caller may read, because the child's rule is folded into
//! the subquery's `WHERE` and a rule that cannot be folded refuses.
