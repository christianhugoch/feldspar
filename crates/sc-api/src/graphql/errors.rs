//! A refusal from the row layer, as the GraphQL error a client can act on.
//!
//! Everywhere else in this provider an [`Error`] reaches the wire through
//! `async-graphql`'s blanket `From<T: Display>`, which keeps the message and
//! throws away everything else. That is enough for a read, whose failures are a
//! developer's to fix while writing the query. It is not enough for a **write**:
//! a mutation is run by an application on behalf of a person filling in a form,
//! and that application has to tell "this row is not yours" from "the server
//! fell over" *without parsing English*.
//!
//! So a mutation's error carries `extensions`:
//!
//! - **`code`** — the class of refusal, from the [`Repr`] the row layer chose.
//!   The vocabulary is the conventional GraphQL one (`BAD_USER_INPUT`,
//!   `FORBIDDEN`, `NOT_FOUND`, `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`) rather than one invented
//!   here, because a client's error handling is written against that vocabulary
//!   long before it meets Saltcorn.
//! - **`table`** — which table refused. A mutation names it in the field, but a
//!   nested refusal (a `File` field's store, a foreign key) need not.
//! - **`field`** — which column a validation failure was about, when it was
//!   about one. The row layer already writes `` `age`: must be at most 120 ``
//!   because that message is shown to a *user* of an application; this lifts the
//!   same name out of the prose so a form can put it on the right input.
//!
//! The message is the row layer's own, unchanged. One statement of what went
//! wrong, in one place — this module only labels it.
