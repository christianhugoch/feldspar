//! The GraphQL [`ApiProvider`] (design §13.4).
//!
//! REST cannot express a *shape* a caller chooses. "For each department, the
//! number of employees earning below 50 000" is not a route; it is a question,
//! and answering it over REST means either inventing a route per question or
//! fetching every employee and counting in the browser. That is what this
//! provider is for, and it is why the milestone exists.
//!
//! It sits beside [`RestProvider`](crate::RestProvider) rather than replacing
//! it: an application enables both, on different mounts, over the same tables.
//! Two endpoints, because that is genuinely all a GraphQL API is —
//! `POST {mount}` carrying `{query, variables, operationName}`, and
//! `GET {mount}/schema.graphql` serving the SDL — so the provider participates
//! in the shared endpoint model and the TypeScript generation exactly as
//! everything else does.
//!
//! **Not a second data path.** Nothing here builds its own `SELECT`. Reads go
//! through `sc-api`'s row and ownership entry points and writes through the row
//! layer's own, so coercion, rich-type validation, `File`-field checks, table
//! events and §7.3 apply *because they are the same code* — not because this
//! provider remembered to do them.
//!
//! **One schema per application, not per role** (decision 4). Hasura compiles a
//! schema per role; we authorize at resolve time and refuse with a GraphQL error
//! naming the table. The schema describes what the *application* exposes,
//! exactly as its [`EndpointSet`](crate::EndpointSet) does — which is also why
//! both endpoints are [`Public`](crate::AuthRequirement::Public): the gate is
//! the table's, at resolve time, not the endpoint's.
//!
//! The pieces: [`names`] derives every GraphQL name (and reports what it could
//! not name), [`types`] maps a column onto the wire, [`build`] folds the tables
//! into an `async_graphql::dynamic::Schema`, [`args`] lowers a field's
//! `where`/`order_by`/`limit`/`offset` onto the row layer's own `RowQuery`,
//! [`agg`] lowers an aggregate selection onto `sc-expr`'s aggregate builders,
//! and [`resolve`] is what the fields do.
