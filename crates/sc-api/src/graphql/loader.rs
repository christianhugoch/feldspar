//! Child lists, batched: one `SELECT … WHERE key IN (…)` per relation per
//! level, never one per parent.
//!
//! A GraphQL selection like
//!
//! ```graphql
//! { departments { name employees(limit: 3) { name } } }
//! ```
//!
//! resolves the `employees` field once per department row, and the naive
//! reading of that is a query per department — the N+1 problem the design
//! (§6) answers with `async_graphql::dataloader::DataLoader`. The loader
//! collects the sibling loads issued while the executor works through the
//! parents and answers them together.
//!
//! **What makes two loads the same batch** is the [`ChildKey`]: the relation,
//! the field's own arguments and the parent's key. Two siblings under one
//! selection share a relation and arguments, so they differ only in the parent
//! and collapse into one read; the *same* relation asked twice under different
//! `where` arguments does not, and gets its own read, because it is a different
//! question.
//!
//! **The child's rules are the child's.** The read is
//! [`ownership::read_row_values_as`] over the *child* table, so its role floor,
//! its ownership formula and its RLS routing decide — the parent's permission
//! to be read says nothing about the child, and a caller who may not read the
//! child table gets an error on that field with the parents still returned.
