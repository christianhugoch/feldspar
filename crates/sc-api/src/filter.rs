//! The comparison vocabulary every filtering syntax lowers through.
//!
//! `eq`/`ne`/`gt`/`gte`/`lt`/`lte`/`in`/`nin`/`like`/`ilike`/`is_null` are what a
//! caller may say about one column, and this module is the **one** place that
//! decides what each of them means. A GraphQL `where: { due: { lt: "2026-01-01" } }`
//! and a REST `?due=lt.2026-01-01` are two spellings of one question, and they
//! reach the row layer as the same [`Expr`] — so a Date filter binds a date in
//! both surfaces, `is_null` means SQL's nullness in both, and a comparison added
//! here appears in both at once. A second lowering would be a second answer, and
//! the one that is wrong is the one nobody is reading.
//!
//! Nothing here reaches SQL as text: the column name comes from the catalog, the
//! operator comes from the `match` below, and every literal the caller wrote
//! becomes an [`Expr::Lit`] the query layer parameterises on render.
//!
//! **Literals are coerced against the column, not against JSON.** A filter value
//! goes through the row layer's own [`rows::column_value`], the same function an
//! insert's body goes through, so `"2026-01-01"` binds a *date* and not a string
//! — the comparison the database performs is then the one the column's type
//! means. The one deliberate exception is `like`/`ilike`, whose argument is a
//! **pattern** rather than a value of the column: `"%urgent%"` is not a legal
//! value for a `String` field with an `options` attribute, and holding a pattern
//! to the column's value rules would refuse a query that is perfectly well
//! formed.
//!
//! Null semantics are SQL's, not JavaScript's: `eq`/`ne` are `=` and `<>`, so
//! neither matches a null, and `is_null` is how nullness is asked about. That is
//! what a caller who knows Hasura or PostgREST expects, and inventing a
//! null-safe `eq` here would make the same filter mean different things in a
//! GraphQL `where`, in a REST query string and in an ownership formula.
//!
//! # The filter **object**
//!
//! Above the vocabulary sits the object every non-URL surface speaks —
//! `{ status: "draft", pages: { gte: 100 }, or: [ … ] }` — and it lives here for
//! the same reason the comparisons do. It was an agent trait's `where` argument
//! first (§11.3); a code body's `db.books.where({ … })` (§10.1) is the same
//! object, and a second walk over it would be a second answer to "what does this
//! filter mean" in a place nobody is reading. [`where_expr`] is that walk, and
//! [`required_where`] is it where the filter is not optional.
