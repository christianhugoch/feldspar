//! Runtime enforcement of ownership formulas (§7.3, TODO Phase 5).
//!
//! The access rule this module implements, stated once: **allowed = the caller
//! meets the operation's `min_role` OR the table's ownership formula grants
//! this row** for this user and operation. Ownership *extends* access below
//! the role floor; it never narrows what a role already has — a caller at or
//! above the floor takes the ordinary unfiltered path and this module never
//! runs for them.
//!
//! Two evaluation strategies, chosen per formula:
//!
//! - **Symbolic** where possible: reads AND the translated predicate
//!   (`UserEnv::Inline`, flags folded) into the SELECT, and guarded writes AND
//!   it into the UPDATE/DELETE's WHERE — the database does the filtering and a
//!   denied row is indistinguishable from an absent one.
//! - **Reified** where not ([`TranslateError::Untranslatable`]): rows are
//!   fetched *with their Ⱶ-join values projected alongside* (one query, not a
//!   round trip per row) and the formula runs in the [`JsEvaluator`]. An
//!   evaluation error **denies** — the evaluator contract — and a missing
//!   evaluator is a configuration error, never an open door.
//!
//! Writes check the row **twice** where it matters (§6's USING/WITH CHECK
//! semantics, here at runtime): an update must be granted on the existing row
//! *and* on the proposed row, so a user cannot move a row out of their own
//! ownership; an insert is checked against the proposed row with `_insert`.
