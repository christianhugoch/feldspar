//! The SDL snapshot: the one test that catches every accidental change to the
//! GraphQL wire contract.
//!
//! Every later phase of this milestone touches the schema builder — filters,
//! ordering, child lists, aggregates, mutations — and each of those is a change
//! somebody meant to make. This asserts that nothing *else* changed with it. A
//! diff here is not a failure to fix by re-running with `--bless`; it is a
//! question to answer: is this the contract we meant to publish?
//!
//! The fixture is deliberately small and deliberately awkward: a parent, a child
//! with **two** keys back to it (so the disambiguating relation names appear), a
//! `File` field, a table whose name GraphQL cannot spell (so its omission is
//! part of the snapshot too), and one column of every scalar family.
//!
//! No database: a schema is a pure function of the tables.
