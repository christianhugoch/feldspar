//! Authorization, cost and the refusals over GraphQL, against a real Postgres
//! (TODO "GraphQL API" Phase 7).
//!
//! Every test here is shaped the same way, because the phase's own rule is:
//! **each authorization rule gets a test that would fail open if the rule were
//! dropped.** An aggregate is never asserted by checking that a number is
//! correct for an administrator — it is asserted by checking what a caller who
//! may *not* see the rows gets, which is either a refusal or the smaller number
//! their own rows make. A test that only checked the admin's number would pass
//! just as happily against a provider that had forgotten to authorize anything.
//!
//! Three groups:
//!
//! - **Row-level security across a correlated subquery.** A child table under
//!   RLS is counted inside the *parent's* statement, so the parent's statement
//!   has to be a caller-context transaction or the child's policies decide with
//!   no caller set. Phase 5 refused this case; Phase 7 answers it.
//! - **The limits.** Depth and complexity are refused before a statement is
//!   issued — asserted by counting statements, not by reading the message — and
//!   the statement budget is refused when it is spent. Introspection stays on.
//! - **What a caller writes must not reach SQL as an identifier.** Aliases,
//!   fragments and variables are the user's input; response keys come from the
//!   operation and column names come from the catalog.
//!
//! The non-RLS half of the ownership rule — the child's translated predicate
//! ANDed into the aggregate's subquery, and the refusal when it cannot be
//! translated — is asserted in `graphql_aggregates.rs`, where the aggregates it
//! bounds are.
