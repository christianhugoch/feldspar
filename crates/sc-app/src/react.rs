//! The opinionated `react` framework: conventions instead of settings (design
//! §13.3, TODO §2.1/§2.2).
//!
//! [`CodeFramework`](crate::CodeFramework) is the right shape for "any bundler,
//! any layout" and the wrong shape for the common case — it asks for five
//! mutually-consistent settings and then assumes a project the admin created over
//! SSH. `react` inverts that: it asks for **the file store and the project
//! directory**, and derives everything else.
//!
//! This module owns the derivations and nothing else. It is deliberately free of
//! I/O: the conventions are pure functions of the project name, so they can be
//! asserted directly, and the scaffolding that writes a project out (§2.3) reads
//! its paths from here rather than restating them. Serving is not reimplemented
//! either — a built React app is a static bundle with an SPA fallback, which
//! [`CodeFramework`](crate::CodeFramework) already serves; the difference between
//! the two frameworks is configuration and scaffolding, not serving.
//!
//! The conventions, for a project named `todo`:
//!
//! | `code` setting | `react` convention |
//! |---|---|
//! | `source`  | `todo` |
//! | `output`  | `todo/dist` |
//! | `command` | `npm run build` |
//! | `client`  | `todo/src/saltcorn/client.ts` |
