//! The `_fd_applications` table: its schema and one-time bootstrap (design §9,
//! §13.2).
//!
//! This is the **one stored-metadata table the MVP needs**, and the reason is
//! the distinction §9 draws between an overlay and a definition. `_fd_tables` /
//! `_fd_fields` are overlays: introspection already yields the tables and
//! fields, so a row only *adds* access rules and attributes, and a legacy
//! database needs none. An application has no such underlying reality — there is
//! nothing to introspect it from — so its row **is** the application.
//!
//! Being an `_fd_*` table it is a system table, hidden from users
//! ([`Table::is_system`](sc_catalog::Table::is_system)), and it obeys the §9
//! required columns: UUID [`id`](COL_ID), [`name`](COL_NAME),
//! [`description`](COL_DESCRIPTION), [`attributes`](COL_ATTRIBUTES).
//!
//! The remaining columns follow the §9 column-vs-attributes rule — *a value
//! present for many rows gets its own column; a sparse value goes into
//! `attributes`* — and every app has all of them, so each gets a column:
//! subdomain, framework, extra frameworks, the table/store subsets, the API and
//! static-dir lists, and the CSP. Only [`subdomain`](COL_SUBDOMAIN) is a scalar
//! the database can index and constrain; the rest are structured lists and maps,
//! stored as JSON. That is deliberate — they are read as a whole app or not at
//! all, and no query filters on them.
//!
//! Like [`sc_auth::bootstrap`], this goes through the [`Catalog`] rather than
//! issuing DDL directly, so it is driver-agnostic, and it invents no
//! database-side defaults: the UUID is generated in Rust when the app is saved.
