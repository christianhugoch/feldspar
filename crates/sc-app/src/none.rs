//! The `none` framework: an application with no UI framework and no build step.
//!
//! Some applications are only what the rest of the record already says — their
//! API providers, their static directories and their streams. A webhook
//! receiver, a data feed, a site of hand-written (or agent-written) HTML and CSS
//! served from a file store: none of them has a bundle to build or a project for
//! Saltcorn to scaffold, and asking the admin for a build command to get one would
//! be asking them to invent a project they do not have.
//!
//! So `none` serves **nothing of its own**. Every request the router has not
//! already answered from an API, a static directory or a stream socket is a 404
//! ([`NoneFramework`]), and because there are no framework paths to protect it
//! declares [`serves_ui`](crate::Framework::serves_ui) `false`, which is what lets
//! an API be mounted at `/`.
//!
//! It is constructed rather than built, so it is registered as a
//! [`FrameworkFactory`] — the seam every "nothing to build" path in the server
//! already asks (saving is the deployment, there is no Build button, there is no
//! generated client to rewrite). Unlike the factories installed from above, it
//! is compiled into this crate and always present
//! ([`framework_factories`](crate::framework_factories)).
//!
//! It still has a **file store and a directory**, for one reason: the coding
//! agent an application is created with (§13.3) needs somewhere to work. What it
//! writes there — HTML, CSS, images — is served by whichever static directory
//! the admin points at it.
