//! Creating a React application's project **on the server** (TODO §2.3).
//!
//! This is the step that removes the SSH requirement, and the reason the `react`
//! framework is more than a settings preset: the MVP's tutorial asked an admin to
//! log into the host, run `npm create vite`, `npm install` and `git init`, and
//! only then fill in five paths. An admin with no shell — which is most of them —
//! could not use the product at all. Here the server writes the project.
//!
//! Three rules the implementation is built around:
//!
//! - **Never overwrite.** Scaffolding into a directory that has anything in it is
//!   refused with an error naming the directory. A generator that clobbers is
//!   worse than no generator, because the work it destroys was the admin's.
//! - **Against the app's real tables.** The project comes up showing real rows in
//!   real columns (see [`files`]), not a placeholder counter. A scaffold whose
//!   first job is to be deleted has not saved anyone any work.
//! - **Failures carry the tool's own output** (§16). A scaffold or install error
//!   is an *Application* error — the admin's configuration or environment — and
//!   the useful part of it is what `npm` or `git` said, not that something
//!   "failed".
