//! The application, as JSON, for a framework that generates its project in a
//! guest language.
//!
//! [`files`](super::files) is the React generator: it holds a [`ProjectContext`]
//! and writes TypeScript. A **declared** framework (`crate::declared`) writes its
//! project in JavaScript, on a module worker, so what it gets is the same context
//! serialised — and this module is that serialisation.
//!
//! # It carries the derivations, not just the data
//!
//! The obvious version of this is "the tables and the endpoint set as JSON, let
//! the module work it out". That is the version that produces a project which
//! does not compile. Whether a page may offer a delete button, what a table hangs
//! off the generated client as, which columns a create form asks for and which
//! the database issues — each is a question `files.rs` answers *by asking the
//! endpoint set*, and each has a wrong answer that looks right. A module
//! re-deriving them from table shapes would agree with the generated client only
//! by coincidence, and stop agreeing at the first table whose name collides with
//! an endpoint or whose key is a UUID.
//!
//! So the answers cross, not the evidence: `ops`, `client`, `form.inputs`,
//! `form.minted`, `pk_ts_type`. The module writes the framework's idiom over
//! facts this crate established.
