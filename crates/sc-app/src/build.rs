//! Wiring a code framework's **build step** (design §13.3).
//!
//! A code framework's source lives in a git repository that is (a sub-directory
//! of) one of the application's file stores, and it has a build step: a bundler
//! is invoked over the source and emits a static bundle, which is what
//! [`CodeFramework`] serves. This module runs that step.
//!
//! The bundler is an external process handed a working directory, so it needs a
//! real on-disk tree — which is why the source store must be one with a
//! [`local_path`](sc_files::FileStore::local_path). An object-store-backed app is
//! rejected with a clear error rather than silently failing to build.
//!
//! Two layers, mirroring the `serve`/`handle` split in [`crate::framework`]:
//! [`run_build`] takes a plain directory and is exercisable without a database,
//! and [`build_app`] resolves the store through the [`Catalog`] and delegates to
//! it.
