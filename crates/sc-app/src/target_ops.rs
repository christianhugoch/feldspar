//! Running a build target's **operations**: what a module does for a target on
//! request, such as generating an Android signing keystore.
//!
//! The module's code decides what to make; Saltcorn decides where it may go. An
//! operation answers files and settings, and this module writes the files into
//! the application's file store — never over an existing one — and sets the
//! settings on the stored application, so the two cannot drift apart: a
//! keystore exists exactly when the settings that name it and hold its password
//! are saved.
