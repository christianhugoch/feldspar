//! Where an application's source is on this machine.

//! Asked by three callers that must agree: `feldspar app list --json`, and the
//! `create_application` and `describe_applications` tools, which hand the
//! directory to an external coding agent so it can go on building there
//! (§13.6). Resolved as a build resolves it — the framework's settings name a
//! store and a directory in it, and the **connected** store says where that is.
