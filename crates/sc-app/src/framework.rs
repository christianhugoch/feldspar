//! The [`Framework`] trait and the [`CodeFramework`] that serves bundled static
//! assets (design §13.3).
//!
//! A framework owns an application's primary UI. **Code frameworks** (React,
//! Next.js, SvelteKit, …) keep their source in a git-repo file store, run a build
//! step, and serve the resulting bundle; the app reaches data only through the
//! API providers, never the database directly. [`CodeFramework`] is the MVP
//! implementation: it serves a pre-built [`AssetBundle`] of static files with an
//! SPA fallback to `index.html`, so a client-routed React app resolves deep links.
