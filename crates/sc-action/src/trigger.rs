//! The [`Trigger`]: what binds an [`Event`](crate::Event) to a configured action
//! (design §10.2).
//!
//! Pure data, like an [`Application`](sc_app::Application) — the row it is stored
//! as lives in [`store`](crate::store), the validation it must pass in
//! [`validate`](crate::validate), and the firing in the dispatcher. A trigger
//! knows nothing about how it is run, which is what lets the same record grow a
//! workflow body later (§10.3) without reshaping anything around it.
//!
//! One trigger = one event + one **body**, and a body is either one configured
//! action or a workflow ([`TriggerBody`], §10.3). Not a list of actions: a
//! sequence of steps is a *workflow*, and conflating the two is what made v1's
//! execution path hard to reason about. Two triggers on the same event is how
//! you get two things done today.
//!
//! The body being an enum is what makes a workflow **a trigger body rather than
//! a new top-level entity**: a workflow inherits its event, its `only_if`, its
//! `min_role`, its enabled flag, its periodic timing, its exposure through an
//! application, and the admin's Run button, with no second copy of any of them
//! to keep in step.
