//! The event model (design §10.2): what happened, to what, and who caused it.
//!
//! An event is deliberately **separate from the trigger that listens for it**.
//! One insert on `books` is one event; it may fire three triggers or none, and
//! nothing about the event changes either way. That split is what lets the row
//! layer emit events without knowing whether anything is listening, and it is
//! what a workflow engine will later listen to with a different body.
//!
//! ## The caller is data, not a type
//!
//! An event carries its caller as a role plus a JSON object of the user's fields
//! — not a `sc_auth::User`. Two reasons: that JSON object is *exactly* what the
//! formula language binds `user` to (§7.3), so an `only_if` evaluation needs no
//! conversion; and it keeps this crate off `sc-auth`, which in turn keeps actions
//! implementable from a guest language, where a Rust `User` cannot travel.
//!
//! ## Cascades are bounded and named
//!
//! An action may write a row, and that write is an event, which may fire another
//! trigger. That is a feature (denormalising into a second table is the archetype)
//! so it is bounded rather than forbidden: an event carries the **chain** of
//! trigger names that led to it, and [`Event::firing`] refuses to descend past
//! [`MAX_DEPTH`], naming the whole chain. A depth counter alone would have caught
//! the loop but left the admin to find it; the chain *is* the diagnosis.
