//! The [`WorkflowEngine`] seam: what a trigger whose body is a **workflow** is
//! run by (design §10.3).
//!
//! Dispatch is layer 6 and the engine is layer 7, so [`TriggerDispatcher`] cannot
//! name `sc-workflow` — the same shape, and the same reason, as
//! [`TableEvents`](sc_catalog::TableEvents): the row layer cannot name a trigger
//! either, so the catalog holds a seam the dispatcher installs itself into. Here
//! the direction is one level up: the dispatcher holds a seam `sc-workflow`
//! installs itself into.
//!
//! One method, because there is one thing dispatch needs of the engine: *start a
//! run of this workflow for this event, and answer what happened*. Everything
//! else the engine does — advancing a run, suspending it, resuming it, retrying
//! it — is driven by the queue and by the admin API, neither of which fires
//! triggers.
//!
//! **Absent, a workflow trigger refuses by name.** A process that installs no
//! engine (a build tool, a unit test) runs every action trigger normally and
//! tells the caller, of a workflow, that nothing here can run one — rather than
//! returning success for a run that was never started, which is the silent
//! failure principle 5 forbids.
