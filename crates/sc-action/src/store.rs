//! The `_fd_triggers` table: its schema, bootstrap, and the [`Trigger`] ⇄ row
//! mapping (design §9, §10.2).
//!
//! A trigger, like an application or a file store, has **nothing to introspect
//! it from**: no column in `information_schema` says "when a row lands in
//! `books`, send a webhook". So by §9's rule its row *is* its definition — this
//! is not an overlay, and without the row there is no trigger at all.
//!
//! **Reading is strict**, as it is for those two: a column that is missing or of
//! the wrong shape is an [`Error::invalid`] naming the trigger and the column,
//! never a silently defaulted field. A half-understood trigger is one that would
//! fire the wrong action, or fire on the wrong event, and the admin needs telling.
//!
//! What is *not* here: validation (see [`validate`](crate::validate), which
//! [`save_trigger`] calls) and caching (see [`Triggers`](crate::Triggers)).
