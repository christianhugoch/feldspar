//! The cached trigger set: what an event is matched against.
//!
//! GOALS: every created entity except users, runs and files is cached in memory,
//! and firing an event must be a lookup rather than a query — a table write that
//! did a `SELECT` on `_sc_triggers` first would put the cost of the *feature* on
//! every write that does not use it.
//!
//! **Loading validates**, and a trigger that fails is dropped from the live set
//! with its reason kept ([`TriggerIssue`]). That is the fail-closed reading, the
//! same one an invalid ownership formula gets: a trigger whose table was dropped
//! or whose action a removed plugin provided must not fire on a guess, and the
//! admin must be able to see why it is not firing — which is what the issues are
//! for (the admin UI surfaces them; the trigger stays editable, so it stays
//! fixable).
