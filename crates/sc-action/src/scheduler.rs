//! The periodic scheduler: one task, one minute at a time (design §10.2).
//!
//! Every other event has something that causes it — a write, a login, a request.
//! A periodic trigger has only the clock, so something has to be watching it.
//! [`Scheduler`] is that: one tokio task started at boot, waking on the minute
//! boundary, asking each periodic trigger whether it is due, and firing the ones
//! that are **through the same [`run_trigger`](TriggerDispatcher::run_trigger)
//! every other direct run goes through**. A scheduled run is not a second kind of
//! run: the `only_if`, the cascade bound and the action are the ones the admin
//! configured.
//!
//! ## The clock is a parameter
//!
//! [`tick`](Scheduler::tick) takes the current time rather than reading it, and
//! the task loop is the only place `Utc::now()` appears. That is what lets a test
//! drive a week of schedule in a millisecond, and it is why the due-time rules
//! ([`Schedule`]) can be asserted against a table of instants rather than by
//! waiting for them.
//!
//! ## What one tick decides
//!
//! For each periodic trigger in the live set:
//!
//! 1. **Seed its clock** if this process has not seen it: from the stored
//!    [`last_run_at`](Trigger::last_run_at), or — for a trigger that has never
//!    run — from *now*. Never from the epoch, which would make every newly
//!    created trigger instantly overdue.
//! 2. **Skip it if it is still running.** A slow action must not stack up: the
//!    missed occurrences are dropped, not queued, because five queued copies of a
//!    report nobody read is worse than one late one.
//! 3. **Fire it if it is due**, in a task of its own, so one slow action delays
//!    neither the clock nor any other trigger — unless it is switched off, in
//!    which case its clock advances and nothing runs (see
//!    [`claim`](Scheduler::claim)).
//!
//! A run's outcome — including its failure — is recorded as a run: a trigger
//! whose action throws every time must not retry every minute for ever, and the
//! failure is reported where every other server-side failure goes.
//!
//! ## Catching up exactly once
//!
//! `last_run_at` is persisted, so a server that was down over a daily trigger's
//! hour comes up, finds it overdue, and fires it **once**. That falls out of the
//! rule rather than being special-cased: the trigger is due when
//! `next_due(last_run) <= now`, and after one run `last_run` is now.
