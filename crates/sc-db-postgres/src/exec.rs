///   violation) — matching on message text is guesswork, and `sc-catalog`'s
///   policy mapping was reduced to exactly that for want of the code;
/// - the server's **message**, which for a row constraint's trigger *is* the
///   sentence the admin wrote for this moment;
/// - the **constraint** it names, which is how the layer above knows *which*
///   rule was broken and whose message to say instead.

/// The format is stable because upper layers read it back
/// (`sc_api::rows::constraint_message`): `<message> [<sqlstate>]` with, when
