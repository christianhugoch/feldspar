//! A stub HTTP server that replays a recorded response — the whole of how the
//! adapters are tested (TODO Phase 1, decision 7).
//!
//! **No test may require an API key or spend a token.** A provider adapter's job
//! is to turn a particular wire format into [`LlmDelta`](sc_llm::LlmDelta)s, and
//! that is exactly what a recorded SSE body exercises: the vendor adds nothing
//! to the test except cost, flakiness and a credential in CI. What the vendor
//! *would* catch — a wire format that changed — is caught by the recorded body
//! being wrong, which is a thing to notice when it happens rather than on every
//! run.
//!
//! Deliberately a raw `TcpListener` rather than an HTTP framework: the server
//! under test is not being tested here, the client is, and this needs to be able
//! to send responses no framework would let it — a body cut off mid-event, a
//! `Content-Length` that lies.
