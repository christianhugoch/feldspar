//! The `openai_responses` adapter: an [`LlmProvider`] over OpenAI's **Responses**
//! API (design §11.1).
//!
//! The Responses API rather than Chat Completions, and that is the whole reason
//! `rig-core` was chosen over the crate the request named: it is where OpenAI's
//! reasoning models are, and where their compatible reimplementations have
//! settled.
//!
//! **`base_url` is a field value, not a code change.** Any endpoint that speaks
//! the Responses API — a local server, a gateway, an alternative vendor — is
//! reached by typing its URL into the provider form. That is what makes
//! "OpenAI-compatible" a configuration fact rather than a list of vendors
//! somebody has to keep extending.
