//! The vocabulary of a model call: what goes in ([`LlmRequest`], [`LlmMessage`],
//! [`ToolSpec`]) and what comes back ([`LlmDelta`], [`AssistantMessage`],
//! [`Usage`]) — design §11.1.
//!
//! **These types are ours, not a provider crate's.** Everything `rig-core`
//! exposes stays behind [`LlmProvider`](crate::LlmProvider), for the reason §2
//! gives generally: a provider abstraction is precisely the kind of dependency
//! whose API churns, and `sc-agent` — which is written entirely against this
//! module — must not churn with it. The adapters in
//! [`openai`](crate::openai) and [`anthropic`](crate::anthropic) are the only
//! code in the tree that names a rig type.
//!
//! They are also **serialisable**, which is not incidental: `sc-agent` persists
//! a run's message history into `_fd_runs` after every step (§11.2), so the
//! history has to survive a round trip through JSON without losing a tool call's
//! id or arguments.
