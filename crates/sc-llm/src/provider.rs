//! [`LlmProvider`]: one configured model, ready to be called, and [`LlmStream`],
//! the one shape a response comes back in (design §11.1).
//!
//! ## Why the trait exists at all
//!
//! Which provider runs is decided at runtime, from a row in `_sc_llm_providers`
//! that an admin filled in. That needs a `Box<dyn _>`, and rig's
//! `CompletionModel` cannot be one: it has associated types, returns
//! `impl Future`, and requires `Clone`. So a seam is needed whatever crate is
//! underneath — this is that seam, and is not much more than it.
//!
//! ## Why streaming is the only shape
//!
//! A non-streaming call is a stream collected to the end ([`LlmStream::collect`]);
//! the reverse is not true, and the chat interface needs deltas from the first
//! turn. One path also means the tool-call assembly that providers each do
//! differently is written and tested once, rather than once per shape.
